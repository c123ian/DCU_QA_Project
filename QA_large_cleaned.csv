"Hello,We were asked by DELL supporter to update iDRAC again for a hardware support, from 6.02.00.00 to 6.10.00.00. After updating, the secure web access to iDRAC failed with error:Bad RequestYour browser sent a request that this server could not understand.Additionally, a 400 Bad Request error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.After doing some tests, I have the following conclusions/workarounds:1. the secure web access failed when using the FQDN of iDRAC interface2. using the IP or short hostname works with the secure web access3. setting iDRAC.WebServer.ManualDNSEntry to have the FQDN included won't solve the issue4. disabling idrac.webserver.HostHeaderCheck aslo works, but could not open virtual console viewer I tried to use racadm command 'sslresetcfg' to regenerate the certificate, but only short hostname used as Common Name (CN) and also only the short hostname listed in the DNS alternative name. By the way, we have DNS BMC/RAC Name and DNS Domain name correctly configured.It looks like to me a new bug in version 6.10.00.00. Though there are not issues with the IP and short hostname access, it is still annoying since we have FQDN defined and linked everywhere. Thanks,Di

"Hello! I want to perform a memory upgrade on my R6515 server.Currently the server has 16x32GB DDR4-2400 RDIMMI bought 16x64GB DDR4-2400 LRDIMM. After the memory upgrade the server only contained these LRDIMM memory modules and nothing was mixed. They were the same brand, speed, type and so just like before.The issue I'm having is that when trying to boot the server with the new memory it doesn't get past the ""Please wait while system is initializing"". It's stuck there forever with no obvious errors.I've tried to pull out the pcie u.2 disks. Try booting with one power supply instead of two. Tried clearing the CMOS but nothing seemed to have solved the issue. If I remove the new ram and put the old ram back in again the system boots fine. It's not clear to me why it's not working because in the specifications the Poweredge R6515 supports both LRDIMM and RDIMM

That is the correct dimm, as you can see the part number I provided embedded under the Manufacturer Part number. To answer your question it doesn't appear that it would run at 3200 when fully populated, it looks to run at 2933 when more than 2 dimms per channel are installed, as seen on page 48 here.

"I have a few Dell PowerEdge servers and have been wordering about Dell numbering the firmware releases.I have updated my iDRAC9 from version 6.10.30.20 to 6.10.80.00. Now I see a release in product support pages for iDRAC update to 7.00.00.00. It doesn't specify (iDRAC""9"") but does show it applies to R7525. Would I update to this version or do I wait for a version specifically indicated for iDRAC9?Regards,DecTec



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","DecTek,
 
We generally aren't in the loop for why certain updates are numbered as they are, but generally when you see it there is either something included or removed from the previous version, or a convergence. 
As far as the update itself, it is the next update for your iDrac, so there shouldn't be an issue with updating to it.
 
Let me know if this helps.

The best way for me to explain it is that Virtualization is used to maximize the use of the system , so a server at full potential isn't a warning situation, but exceeding it is.

"I am having issues with my 740xd recognizing my intel x520 10gb pcie card as a network interface. When I go under System > PCIe slots, it shows the slot as populated with a ""82599 10 Gigabit TN Network Connection"" intel 8 lanes gen 3 but no part or serial number and says health status Ok.Under Hardware Inventory, it shows all the info as well. It is in a PCIe gen 3 x16 slot so wondering if that has any affect being a x8 card but I wouldn't think it should.When I go under System > Network Devices it only shows the Integrated NIC 1 QLogic 577xx/578xx 10 Gb Ethernet BCM57800 but not the intel pcie nic.So under LifeCycle Controller > System Setup I see the Intel x520-t2 adapter show up with the MAC address populated, but when I try to click on it, it just exits the system setup screen back to the main lifecycle controller menu screen.So I tried to update the driver for x520 via usb but get this error message ""Unable to complete the firmware update operation because the specified firmware image is for a component that is not in the target system inventory.""What am I missing here?

"Hello,I have an old DELL T310 that is working perfectly for my needs.I need to install a 2,5gbps network card or 10gbps, to reach the maximum speed of the 2,5gbps internet fiber connection. The dell t310 pci bus speed can reach at least 2,5gbps?I have already installed a SAS Pci card with 6 HD...it's the pci bus speed shared?I can install any cheap 2,5gbps network card?Really thank you.Regards.



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","be aware that intel based 2.5gbps nics are only 1 port. If you need a 2 port 2.5 nic, it will be a Realtek. Realtek in a lot of cases needs you to install additional drivers so wont necessarily be plug and play.also there are 2 port 2.5g intel nics, but the chipset only supports 2.5gbps total throughput, so those cards only have 1.25gbps per port depending on how they have it built. so not 'true' dual port 2.5gbps like the realtek ones.

"Not sure where to start with this one. Been searching everywhere I could; websites, forums, discord, etc. but I keep coming up with no answer.I recently installed 4x 8GB ECC more sticks into my R510 which gives me a total of 8x 8GB. However, when I install the RAM into the A4 & B4 slot, the server randomly hard shuts down. No errors or warnings. The sticks are 8GB, ECC and registered, RDIMM, 1333Mhz. 32GB is Samsung, 32GB is Hynix (other than brand, they are completely identical)Have done memory testing on A1-A3/B1-B3 with sticks installed and diagnostic comes back passing. It crashes when I try to do tests with RAM in A4/B4.Is the mobo dying, or the CPU... or is there some other tests I can perform? CPU issue?  Much appreciated for any tips or if someone has come across this before and has an answer.

"Hi,I see on the manual of the T630 server, on the installation guidelines, that each GPU should only support up to 6 GB of memory. So does that mean the server will not fully use the NVIDIA TESLA K80 GPU, which has 12 GB of memory? Does anyone here have experience running GPU on a T-PowerEdge Server?Thank you for any support. It is a very old model from my university lab that I don't know where to seek help...Some further questions...Does the T630 support the TESLA K80 GPU, which has more than 6 GB of memory?There are 4 slots of PCIe x16, will it fully support 4 GPUs? The manual says that installing 2xGPUs has a higher priority than 4xGPUs, does that mean the 3rd and 4th are downclocked?How to check if it even supports GPU? I saw that it needs to be ""GPU-enabled"" or something to run GPUs. I got the tower from my university without any further information...Robin

					Go to Solution.","Hello, Yes, it is doable. I am currently running 4x K80 in my server, which is essentially an 8x GPU setup. Runs great. You just need to note some parts as you set them up.Power breakout board: I think it is called a ""power distribution"" board, but check the parts for them. That board is located at the bottom of the motherboard. Lift up the MOBO, insert the power board in the extended slot (pretty easy), and insert the MOBO back.Power cable: Pin layout of this power board and the cable is basically an 8x PCIe power layout. PCIe in, PCIe out. (3 yellow power and black ground pairs, with 1 pair of ground). The problem is that, K80 uses a CPU power layout (4 yellow power and black ground pairs). You need an adapter or appropriate cable (Search for PCIe male to CPU or ATX male). We rewired the cables ourselves.https://i.stack.imgur.com/Spsgx.pngFrom the specification of the board, each slot of the power breakout board can carry 300W (standard design is supposed to be 150W instead of 300W, so this is special for the T630), so it has no problem supporting 1 K80 each. So, one PCIe power slot would split into 2 CPU power slots. We have been running it fine for 2 years now, no problem. Be careful to pick a good power cable though. Thing is, you will read online that standard PCIe slots can only support 150W, and when running it, the T630 will give a notification of ""power overloading"". If you want to be safe, you can just do 2x K80.Install a stronger power supply. There are two slots for the PSU, dont care about the 2nd, they dont add to your system. You need a single strong PSU. The second is the spare PSU, which is there to ensure power redundancy.Fan array : With the GPU installed, the server won't run without the fan array (4-fan array in the middle of the chassis). Problem is, these fans are completely useless in cooling down the K80s. Therefore, you can just buy some jumpers or something to bypass it. Or just install the fan array per the requirement.Fan mod: K80s need a fan directly attached on one end of it, being a passive cooling solution. We just attach two server fans at the backend of the chassis, they cool the K80s down fine. Cover the slots where there are no GPU, leave only the ones with the GPU opened to increase pressure into them.

"Hello
I got Dell PowerEdge T320 8x3.5"", seems that all working as intended but some points don't let me sleep well:
1. My server is OEM, how i can turn it to normal one so in IDRAC i will see server model ? as i googled i find that it was possible but for other server model https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/R710-BIOS-rev-and-model-information-missin...
2. In Lifecycle Controller i missing one menu item - Configure RAID and Deploy OS, there only gear icon and then blank space, how i can get all menu items ?

Bios and other stuff was upgraded to latest versions
 



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","So I've never done this on the T320 specifically but I've done this on other models of this generation.You will want to download this and extract the .pm file from the .exe that will be downloaded.https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=dgpgh&oscode=ws8r2&productco...Once you have the .pm file downloaded you will log into the idrac web gui and go to the update section and direct it to the .pm file. Once done go to the job queue and wait for the job to complete.Then go to the diagnostics tab within the idrac and press the reset to default settings button and let that complete.  Once that reset has completed after a few minutes go to the server itself and do a complete reboot and it should go into a rebranding process after the POST process completes and it will reboot after. After the reboot you should start seeing Dell logos and everything should be more or less back to stock Dell.

"I'm looking for a server that can take one scalable CPU (for now) and has support for NVMe drive bays. I checked R640 and R740xd but online configuration says that you need two CPUs to have NVMe support. Are all the NVMe drives really just connected to CPU2 on the motherboard? Or is this a sales thing and not a technical limitation?

					Go to Solution.","Just an update for future reference. We solved our problem by going with Dell's AMD models instead. AMD CPUs have more PCIe lanes so they can support more NVMe drives and I/O in general on just one CPU.The R6515 and the R7515 are the ones we looked at. The R6515 would be the equivalent of the R640 and the R7515 the equivalent of R740xd.We went with R6515 model (1U) in the end as it had two extra PCIe slots as well as up to 10 NVMe/SAS/SATA drives using just the single CPU.

To delete the data on the hard drives you could create a dissimilar array and do a Full Initialization.
Say you have a RAID1
Boot in to the controller and delete the virtual disk. Then make a single drive RAID0 on each of the drives and do Full Initialization on the RAID0's.

The T330 server does not support GPU cards. GeForce GTX 1080 Ti has not been tested and certified to function on the T430 server. It may(not) work. Below are details of GPU cards that have been tested on T430 server.


However, for any of these cards to operate correctly, you will need: 

Redundant PSU configuration (PIB)
One 1100 W power supply
GPU power cable (DPN#: DRXPD)

"Greetings!I am adding 16TB x 1 SATA HDD hot-plug hard disk to add more storage in our Dell PowerEdge T440 Server, that currently has RAID-1 (446GB x 2 SATA SSD) and RAID-5 (3725GB x 4 SATA HDD).  The added new HDD is in the current state Ready (not Online).  Question:  What is the best way to add this additional hard disk?  Can I add this to the existing RAID-5?  Or, will it be better to create a new Virtual Disk?  I am okay either way and I really appreciated any guidance.Thanks a  lot for your help!current physical disks statuscurrent physical virtual status



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello ebk528,
 
It is always recommended you verify the status of your backup before doing any changes on the array(s).
 
You could create a single drive RAID 0 to get the full capacity.
 
You could also do Online Capacity Expansion (OCE) to add it to the RAID5. It will not use the entire 16TB. It will only use up to the smallest drive capacity in the RAID5. So that would mean it would use up to 3725GB of the 16TB drive. The rest is unusable.
If you do the OCE, make sure you beginning and ending RAID level is RAID 5.

"Hi, I think the BIOS settings will default after a CMOS battery replacement. But please, can someone confirm this?I have PowerEdge R430.Also, is any way to backup BIOS settings over iDRAC 8?TY TY TY.



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello Alexander,
 
You are correct. If the battery is out for any length of time the BIOS would revert to defaults.
 
If you have the iDRAC Enterprise license you can Back up the server profile
https://dell.to/3WOQlhW
 
Backup server profile
Use this licensed feature to perform the following and store the backup image files in a vFlash SD card:
*Back up the following:
*Hardware and firmware inventory such as BIOS, NDCs, Lifecycle Controller supported add-in NIC cards, and Storage Controllers (RAID level, virtual disk, and controller attributes)
*System information
*Lifecycle Controller firmware images, data and configuration, and iDRAC firmware and configuration
*Optionally, secure the backup image file with a passphrase.
 
I think the BIOS in the firmware inventory is just the firmware version. I don't see a way to back up the individual BIOS settings.
You may go through the BIOS and note down any specific settings or take pictures of the BIOS pages with the custom settings you have.

"Hi,Since nothing is working on my T620 and its completely dead, I thought about checking if maybe the Front Panel is broken, and reseating the cables might do something. However, I cannot get the Panel out? I watched a video on how to do it, which is just loosening one screw, but that did not work for me. How do I get the dang thing out???Second question: If indeed my Motherboard is broken, wouldn't there still be power on the front panel? I mean, isn't that what the Panel is for, to tell you if and what is not working properly?Anything helps.Thanks.

It could be a couple things, such as that your configuration may require removing the cooling fan assembly. You can find the details on page 114 here.

"I have a PowerEdge c6100 arriving soon.   It is a bottom end model with the Xeon 5520 processors. For the majority of what this server will be used for, that is more than enough. But for one blade the application in it will vastly benefit from a higher frequency rather than multi-cores. Doing a quick check I found that the 5520 is a socket 1366.  But when I check spec sheets for the server it mentions only the 5500 and 5600 series processors.  A little more digging shows that those 2 series were just factory options.   To my question: Is this server ~ONLY~ compatible with the 55/56 series processors or is it compatible with anything that fits the socket so to say?  Before I spend another grand on 2 CPUs with 3.4 Ghz I would like to know if they would work!

"Hi there,I've got a PowerEdge R320, great deal, £70 for an E5-2450, 48gb ram, dedicated enterprise iDRAC, both 350w PSU's and 3TB HDDs with a raid controller. However, I'm having lots of trouble when I'm running into updating the iDRAC firmware. I'm a bit of a neat freak so I'd really love everything to be as up-to-date as possible and I've gone through countless steps trying to fix this. Right now, It's on version 2.21.21. I haven't had any trouble updating the BIOS firmware but I have now rolled it back to its original 2.4.2 from having updated it to 2.9.0 . I have installed Windows Server 2012 R2 on it to try and get it to install from there but still no hope. I don't actually get that much of an error message when i do it, but its usually RED004. I've had a couple times where I've tried and the website comes up with iDRAC 8 instead of  iDRAC7. I have also tried hard resetting it with the command:racadm racreset hard -f Although this works to get iDRAC back into it's regular state after the firmware update going weird, trying again just gives similar errors and I have tried updating via the web page. This has been trying to upgrade to 2.30.30 and 2.65.65 I believe. Any help is much appreciated!



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hi Joey,Today is the day it happened!I successfully updated the iDRAC firmware to 2.65.65.65 from 2.21.21.21.Firstly, I'd like to say thank you for your help in troubleshooting the situation and sticking with me throughout this nightmare.After having tried every method under the sun, iDRAC would still not update. Luckily, I found a great guy on YouTube (shoutout to him) going over his steps to fix a bricked iDRAC. Luckily, in my situation my iDRAC wasn't necessarily 'bricked'; iDRAC had no problem working even after the hundred failed firmware update attempts that I had tried. Although my situation wasn't exactly like his, the methods used to try and treat a bricked iDRAC managed to treat mine as well.So these are the steps I took to fix this problem (For an R320 or similar) Just to be said, I am not a qualified electrician. These are purely the steps I took to overcome this problem:You will need:USB UART device, one capable of 3.3v. (Cheap from Amazon)Soldering ironSD Card in the FAT format loaded with the firmware.d7 file in the root folder.iDRAC Enterprise cardSpare PC or Laptop with PuTTY installed.Make sure you export your iDRAC license. This can be done by the web GUI. If necessary also export you iDRAC settings as this will completely wipe all iDRAC configuration.On the motherboard there will be a BMC_UART port right next to the rear I/O of the MB. The connection pinout is: R320 (or similar) BMC_UARTFunctionPin 1 (Square Pad)Vdd (3.3v)Pin 2TxPin 3RxPin 4GNDSolder 4 jumper wires onto the board and connect them to the USB UART dongle as followed. Make sure the server is off!Connect to the serial port in PuTTY with your COM interface (if you're unsure what interface to use, check device manager) with a baudrate of 115200 using TELNET. Now you can boot the server. If those steps were successful, you should now see the uboot process of the server. If it has booted successfully, you should be greeted with a linux shell but in this situation we wont be needing that. Although it's a good idea to test your UART wiring so you are able to send text to the console.This next step can be a bit tricky. You now need a paperclip or anything else you can use to short a switch on the MB. The switch is located near the large silver heatsink, named SW2. To reboot the system, short switch 1. Now this is the tricky part - quickly switch over and short switch 2 while spamming any key in the console. If you are lucky, you will see the uboot process has been interrupted and you now have an iDRAC prompt. It will look something like: iDRAC 7/8=>With the FAT formatted SD card loaded with the fimware image, run: util recover -emmc -from sd -f firmimg.d7 -noreset -clean  If you are successful, it should have erased the EMMC and installed the new firmware. You can now unplug the server when it's safe to do so and drain the power by holding the power button down for 30 seconds. Unfortunately if you were unsuccessful, you may have a bad EMMC chip, I have read that these can go bad from perhaps too many write cycles.When booting up, you may or may not have the lifecycle controller telling you an update is required or spit out a firmware error. This is ok, just reboot the server a couple times and it should return to normal. Boot into the lifecycle controller and click 'about' in the top right corner. Voila! The iDRAC firmware should now be up-to-date! To restore the iDRAC license, go to the Platform Restore section and import the license. You will need a USB stick with your exported license on it. You can now unsolder the BMC_UART connection if you wish and uninstall the SD Card from the iDRAC Card.Here is a labelled photo of the MB to guide you: Here are the forums that helped me:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvSDNAi39YY&ab_channel=JunctionRunner https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/bsou3n/dell_r520_idrac_7_swc0700_and_idrac8_prompt/ https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/a49b4y/r720_idrac_help/ https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/problem-dell-r720xd-idrac-bios-recovery/32658/95 Many Thanks!

"Hi,- T620 would get stuck on ""Configuring memory"" while booting. Never made it past that.- I then read about pressing ESC repeatedly while that message comes up and it actually worked.- Now my T620 would still show ""Configuring memory"" but after a minute it would say ""Configuring memory...Done"" and continue to boot.- It would now show a Memory Training Failure (RAM 1 and 3) while booting, but still boot. Only difference was that now I only had 48GB instead of 64GB, which made sense since my RAM is 8 x 8. - I was able to use the T620 just fine.- Installed a PCIe x 1 card into a PCIe x 16 (or is it x8?) slot and of course it would not work. The T620 would ""start"" but I would not see anything on the screen. I tried that twice and then took the PCIe x 1 card out again.- I switch RAM 1 with 2 and vice versa to see if the RAM is broken or the Motherboard.- Press the power button. Nothing. Took the power cable out, pressed for 10 seconds the power button, waited a minute, still nothing. The T620 makes no sound at all. ZERO. - Switched the RAM back the way it was, still nothing.- Checked the CMOS battery and it says 3 Volts, that it can't be that. I guess.At this point I have no idea why the T620 suddenly would not work anymore??? I heard no popping or smelled anything when plugging in the PCIe x 1 card because at the beginning I would that is what ""killed"" it. But I read online that people actually use PCIe x1 in x8 or x16 slots. So, no issue with that. I think.I only have one Power supply and its green light is on. What the heck would make the T620 stop working like that???Thanks.

I would start out with first draining the flea power by disconnecting AC power cables and then press and hold the power button for about 15 seconds, once you do that open the cover and take the server to its minimum to post configuration, that is removing everything internally and externallly from the server, including mouse and keyboard, except the following :

System Board
CPU1 with heat sink (minimum for troubleshooting)
Single DIMM configuration with DIMM in socket A1 (preferably not one previously erroring)
Control Panel with cable (to power system on)
PSU (and for redundant PSU also the PDB/PIB)

 
After that power up and see if the no video issue is resolved. If so then add each of the removed devices back individually until the issue reappears, or all the devices are reinstalled without issue, this should help identify if there is a device causing the issue,
Now if the system doesn't start under the minimum to post configuration, then it is one of the devices I listed above causing the issue.
 
Let me know what you see.

					Go to Solution.","Hi, I can check if you can post the part number if the card you are using is compatible with the server. 

Make sure the adapter is securely inserted in the server’s PCIe slot and the cables are plugged in correctly.
In the BIOS setup, check the network adapter and enable or not.
Download and install the latest driver for the adapter.
Open Device Manager on the server and check if the adapter is listed. If not, scan for hardware changes. If the adapter is still not detected, it may be defective and need to be replaced.
Check the network cable connection between the adapter and the switch. A faulty or loose cable can cause network problems.""

"I am going in circles on this one. This is an older PowerEdge T320 with a PERC H310 control and iDRAC v7 controller. It has been in production and now we've taken it offline. We were going to set it up to do some testing but after deleting the RAID configs on both drives, we can't seem to figure out why we are getting this issue.In the PERC controller Adapter BIOS, I started by deleting both VD'sNext, I created new VD's and did a quick initialization on both.After I did that, when I look at the screen, it shows 0GB for total free capacity. I continue on and ESC out of that screen, reboot the serverI have attached pictures



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello jdb789,
 
Try these steps:
 
Give the system a flea power drain.
drain flea power (shut down, disconnect power cables and Network cables, hold in power button 20 seconds with cords removed).  After flea power drain, system has to set for 3 minutes for DRAC to reset without any power plugged in, then plug in NIC and power but wait 2 minutes before power on to give DRAC time to initialize.
 
 
Then boot into the LifeCycle controller <F10> and let it sit at the main page. The system either needs to be booted into the LifeCycle controller or an OS so that a driver will load and the DRAC will see the drives.
 
Check the DRAC Storage to see the drives.
 
If it does not show then give the DRAC a reboot and check again.
 
If it still does not show or as maintenance after they show, I'd recommend to check that the H310, BIOS and iDRAC are on latest firmware.

"Hey I was given a PowerEdge T630 server. I want to use it as a 2nd Windows 10 system to run my OBS streaming. I know overkill, but its what I was given. I have zero understanding of how a server should behave. I cant get a video signal out of it. I only have dealt with personal desktops which I'm comfortable with. I seek just how to install Windows 10 on this device and I should be able to figure the rest out. I see the back IO panel has two PCI slot bays for cpu1/2 and the center of the IO panel is labeled ""iDrac"" The VGA port located in ""iDrac"" does not show video, nor does the VGA at the front IO panel near the power button. . Let me know what I can do to help anyone make sense of this and what I may need to read to help myself. Thank you!

That being said, what I suggest you start with is updating the servers BIOS, iDrac, and the H710 to current. Then see ifthe situation and information is the same, if so then you should be fine removing and replacing, but lets confirm that after updating.

The LSI raid card might run hotter it runs 63c on slow fan and maybe 60c on higher.(put in a bat file) run from desktop icon.  Had issues running it on start up. might work with a delayed startup.======================racadm racreset soft====================

"I am going to remove the mid plane on my R730XD as I don't need the drive bays and switch back to the base configuration/standard heatsinks in hopes of dropping CPU temps to make the fan noise more reasonable.My question is that there appears to be an option for some beefier 165w rated heatsinks (PN: XCYJ9 and NGC09) do these fit under the stock air shroud ( PN: Y43D5) or do I need to get a different shroud?

Everything worked without problemsUpgraded to dual E5-v4 cpus (E5-2697v4) without changing anything else.Bios, and all firmware is up to date using idrac to update. Bios version 2.16.0Now only ram in slots to the left of the CPU show up at all. Slots to the right of the bios show errors when posting that the memory in slot XX had a recoverable training error and to try reseating the dimms.For example, install eight 8GB sticks of 1Rx8 Ram following manual  in A1,A2,A3,A4,B1,B2,B3,B4.A1,A2,B1,B2 doesnt show up, but does in A3,A4,B3,B4. Bios only reports 32GB of ram. Lifesycle controller -> system assessment only shows ram in A3,A4,B3,B4All of the slots to the left of the CPU show up, all of the slots to the right of the cpu do not.If i go back to the E5-v3 cpus, everything works normal. all ram in all slots show up. If I try single E5-v4 cpu configuration, for both cpus, same issue. So it is not the mobo, the ram, or the cpu at the hardware level that is causing the problem (to my knowledge)I also tried entirely different 1Rx4 ram and same issue.  Also, The ram only runs at 1866 speed, despite all the dimms being 2400T speed and exactly the same (all 1Rx8 and all same mfg) Cant figure this one out. The memory configuration is set to optimizer mode, so it isnt one of the weird modes where only half the ram shows up to the OS. Here is a photo of what i mean on left of the cpu. All sticks in this image show up properly, but any sticks put in the slots occupied by blanks do not show up.

"Hi There, I was after some advise/experience.... We have a number of servers that have small, 1gb SD Cards, currently running ESXi 6.7  I have a bunch of kit that i need to keep going for a while until funded replacements are available.  I however, do need to update these to ESXi7.  I was looking at utilizing existing setup, however i need a minimum 8GB SD Card to be able to do this.I havent tested this yet (and will do) but i was wondering if there is the possibility of putting 2 different size cards into an IDSDM module, eg 1gb & 8GB and then mirror the 1GB > the 8GB to retain the setup, which could then be upgraded to ESXi 7 with the additional space.Any ideas? Thanks.

To my assumption (without any documented information, I can't be sure), the BIST button completes the circuitry of the SMPS (PSU) and it manages to supply power to the mainboard. I would recommend trying replacing the PSU first. I won't rule out mainboard as the root cause.

yes you can fill all memory slots with the same memory.
Also you can see this information:
 
Enables you to set the Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX) option.

Kind of a hack though, since it seems the Dell implementation of cooling unknown 3rd party cards is to just ramp up the fans a ton [WARNING] make sure to run stress tests to make sure the cooling profile is adequate.

"Hey y'all,Was looking into upgrading the RAM in my R620 and having a bit of difficulty determining the supported memory configurations using dual Intel Xeon E5-2640 processors.

Not sure if this is something that was later enabled via a firmware update (since the original spec sheet does show a max of 768GB), or just a miss in the documentation.I'd appreciate any insight into the actual supported memory configurations and if I'd be able to run 64GB LRDIMMs with my processor.Thanks!Alex

Even expired support services (warranty contract), you can still download firmware updates. If the server is at its end of service life, engineering will not be releasing new firmware updates.

"Hi Everyone,We have a M1000e chassis with 2 Brocade M6505 FC IOMs (B1/B2) and 9 working blades (M620/M630). The Brocades have 12 port licenses from which 1 is available. Brocades have DPOD mode enabled.The switchshow command shows active ports as 'N16 Online FC F-Port <HBA WWPN>' and the unused but licensed port 'In_Sync FC Disabled (Persistent)'.When we insert a new M630 blade with a dual port FC Qlogic QME2662 mezzanine HBA in slot B (fabric B), status of port 11 does not change and there is no connection indication on the Brocade, and the blade iDRAC shows the port 'down' and 'No Link'.  Note that the M630 has already OS installed (XenServer).We issue the ""portcfgpersistentenable 11"" command but we get: ""Port 11: portcfgpersistentenable failed. Configuration operation is not supported on internal (server blade) port.""The same blade was inserted to a slot of another already working blade and the switch detected it normally, showing the WWPN and the port going 'online' both on Brocade and in iDRAC. That eliminates any blade misconfiguration possibility. In this port portcfgpersistentdisable and portcfgpersistentenable commands are working normally. Note that when this slot is empty it shows as 'No_SigDet' and not as 'Disabled (Persistent)'.We included port 11 in the zoning configuration (forcibly aliasing the blade's WWPN) but no change in port status. Are we missing something here? Does anyone have an idea on how to proceed?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Thank you Charles for your reply! Yes, we had already tried the other working blade in this slot and didn't work, so we were sure that this was a Brocade and not a blade issue. Also our Brocades are not configured in Access Gateway mode but in Native mode.After all basic and advanced troubleshooting has been done on the Brocades we decided to do a rolling restart on the 2 FC switches. After the reboot the first Brocade immediately detected the new M630 on (licensed) port 11 as 'N16 Online FC F-Port <HBA WWPN>'. The second Brocade did not immediately detect the blade but after a 'portcfgpersistentenable 11', which now worked without error, it detected the new blade too!The rolling reboot did not affect the production traffic at all, as the system (XenServer) had multipath enabled with active-active configuration.So, case is closed.

"I have a T130 server (1 week old) and since adding a Broadcom 5722 (single port NIC) the cooling fan has speeded up significantly (and very noisily). Running OpenSUSE 42.1 and functionally all is perfect.
I cannot get anyone from DELL to reply to my query that if I lash out and buy a ""supported"" NIC (which it seems will have to be a minimum of a DP which is a waste as I only want one additional port) will the ""supported"" cards result in a similar noisy machine ?
The Broadcom 5722 is rated at 1.41 Watts. The ""supported"" Broadcom cards (5719 or 5720) have power ratings of 1.21 -> 2.06 Watts (5720) and 2.41 -> 4.12 (5719) so, if the ""supported"" cards don't cause a fan speed increase then I see no justification for this happening with the 5722 card.
I understand there is some way to defeat/modify this fan speed algorithm but I do not understand how to do this on a Linux based machine - there is a gap in my knowledge.

"Hi All,I have searched high and low for a reference to this interesting situation to no avail.  I have a EMC T440 that originally came with  a single Xeon Silver 4110 CPU.  I have since added a second processor - primarily to gain access to the single PCIe x16 slot tied to CPU2.  The processor is functioning just as expected and has even passed every stress-test I have thrown at it.While investigating an issue where installation of a GPU in that aforementioned x16 slot is triggering the chassis fan to ramp up to high-speed unnecessarily, I ventured into iDRAC (I don't really use it that much otherwise).  It is here where the second CPU is detailed (Cores, L1/L2/L3 cache, etc), but indicated to be ""Absent"" - while CPU1 shows ""Presence Detected"".Normally, I would just dismiss this since the CPU is functioning as it should where it matters.  But since I am unable to adjust the thermal profile for that slot with the GPU in it, I am starting to wonder if iDRAC's incorrect marking of the presence of the CPU is also leading to issues with the PCIe slot linked to it - and subsequently leading to the issues with setting LFM with the GPU present.  It should be noted, the GPU, a not-officially-supported BUT Dell-branded Radeon is also not detected in iDRAC either.  Since the lone PCIe x16 slot is linked to CPU2, I am starting to think these issues may be related.CPU2 shows ""Absent""BUT, it details the specs of an ""Absent"" CPU.  But CPU2 is certainly here - 2 x 16 Threads (8 Physical Cores) = 32.So, any ideas on why iDRAC does't think CPU2 is socketed (but can detail its specs)?  Is there some contact on the socket perhaps that triggers iDRAC's detection of the CPU's presence?  I DID have to slightly modify the heatsink module bracket to get the CPU to socket properly.  And while the CPU if functioning properly, is there some contact switch down there that this modification is failing to trigger perhaps?

"Generally when replacing PowerEdge servers I can reuse the previous generation's sliding rails. However these R340s are giving me problems as they don't appear to be compatible to anything. I found the DellEMC Enterprise Systems Rail Sizing and Rack Compatibility Matrix which tells me that A12 rails are compatible.So we bought the A12 rails but they have the same problem as the previous rails I was using for the R320s. The new R340s have their first mount point set back from the front. So when I place the server in the rails they end up sticking out of the front of the server cabinet. What rails are compatible with PowerEdge R340 servers? Thank you.

"PowerEdge Server R620 Rack ServerRecently we are facing a strange issue on our R620 server. Normally powering on the server, it picks up machine sound and noise until in start up mode and then slows down and operate normally like it should.However since yesterday, we see that when the server is powering on, the machine sound and noise is picking up and throttle at highest thereby creating immense noise and thrust.. it feels like the server is operating at full power capacity or some boosting up at highest capacity utilizing the full power.This does not look like any hardware issue though i think some hardware configuration/BIOS/Power Config issue might prevailI've reset the server using Lifecycle Controller in Hardward Configuration for Factory default reset. Changed BIOS settings and system profile, disabled Turbo Boosting but nothing is changing.How should this be fixed?

"Hi,we have an old R720 server that came with a PERC H310 Mini Mono controller.Since that stock controller has no cache memory, we would like to replace with with a newer PERC.Looking around the forum I have found old threads that indicate the H710p Mini Mono as a compatible replacement.However, I can only find used/refurbished units from third-party sellers, within a very large range of prices, and that leaves me quite unsure about what to do.I wonder: is there an even newer PERC that is compatible with our server? Or is the H710p the best choice?Is there hope of getting one from Dell? Can anyone recommend a seller?Thanks.

"I have a Dell R320 that has been running well for about 2 years. All of a sudden I find that the screen was frozen and that the mouse and keyboard do not function. After rebooting the hardware it told me that there were no disks installed. I reconfigured the machine and it sees the disk as it did before. Now it gets to the point of initializing but freezes there . If it had not froze the next step would have been collecting the life cycle data. Therefore my question is if there is any software I can run to find out what has gone wrong? I did test the disk in question in another R320 I have and it boots normally. Any suggestions or questions are welcome.

This is actually a little worse that having the IDPA left behind!My preference would be to restore, but I'm open to direction on how to *set* that information (which I can't seem to find much information on how).Additionally, the directions from the ""Dell PowerEdge OEMR 14G ID Module"" have a very confusing direction of,""16. Custom Branding is now complete. You may now validate all of the custom branding options you have selected including Logos, BIOS Settings, iDRAC Settings, and Lifecycle Controller settings.""This leads me to believe that the ""Dell PowerEdge OEMR 14G ID Module"" is actually trying to *set* OEM pieces and not restore. Is there an easy way to set the information? Also, what is the purpose of the ""9GFXR_Cust_5_00.pm"" versus the ""9GFXR_CustBSU_5_00.pm""? I can't figure that information out at this time.

Usually, the sales team has such matrix sheets. I looked a lot, but I found topics like Expansion card installation guidelines that you have already seen. I can't be 100% sure of the part codes needed for these. I don't want to mislead. I would contact to local sales team.

"Hello Everyone ,i am new to this forum and hope someone can help mewe have a list of servers in our environment and was wondering if there is a way to have a command line utility or a script that i can use to set the Asset tag on all the servers.we are talking about a long list so if there any way to automate this via a script and pending a reboot would be appreciated  



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Yeah, don't listen to these other guys. They clearly aren't reading or understanding your question. Since you want to script it, you'll want to use racadm. The command is going to look like this:racadm>>get BIOS.MiscSettings

racadm get BIOS.MiscSettings
[Key=BIOS.Setup.1-1#MiscSettings]
AssetTag=
ErrPrompt=Disabled
ForceInt10=Disabled
NumLock=On

racadm>>set BIOS.MiscSettings.AssetTag 12345

racadm set BIOS.MiscSettings.AssetTag 12345
[Key=BIOS.Setup.1-1#MiscSettings]
RAC1017: Successfully modified the object value and the change is in
       pending state.
       To apply modified value, create a configuration job and reboot
       the system. To create the commit and reboot jobs, use ""jobqueue""
       command. For more information about the ""jobqueue"" command, see RACADM
       help.After that, you'll want to create a job like this:racadm jobqueue create BIOS.Setup.1-1 -r noneAnd then reboot the machine since most BIOS changes require a reboot. Not sure if this one does or not. You should test this first, of course.racadm serveraction powercycle How you wrap your script will be up to your scripting skills, preferred language, or environment. I use python with pexpect to simulate an interactive session. I use a lot of regex and catch expected output from racadm. Beware that output may vary from generation to generation (e.g. iDRAC8 and iDRAC9 have different output strings).

Glad to hear you got the issue resolved. To answer your question,
I believe that is a board based voltage sensor, associated to the chipset.

					Go to Solution.","Hello sci-hpc,
 
I'm sorry to see the failed drives. I would recommend to consider if you have a backup and  if you need this data but do not have a valid backup that you should contact a Data Recovery company.
 
Along with what Shine mentioned; the other very concerning thing I see is all the drives report 0GB in size (capacity).
Do the drives spin up? Are there any lights lit on the drives?
 
I can't imagine this happen with just a restart unless some previous issues have been occurring or you have experienced an issue that regular firmware updates could have mitigated. The system is very far behind in firmware and it could be some issue happened that may have been resolved with regular updates. I can't say for sure I'm just trying to give possibilities.
 
Have you reviewed the iDRAC System Event Log for any issues before this happened?
 
So after you consider the status of your backup you can try these steps below. I say to consider if you need data recovery as any troubleshooting could make it harder for data recovery if it is possible at all.
 
 
The array configuration is stored in two places; the drives and the controller.
You may try shut down, unseat all drives, boot to the controller and  clear the configuration and shut down.
Then seat all the drives and boot into the Controller BIOS to see if it imported the arrays or has a foreign configuration that you can import.
 
Next steps you can update the system firmware and retry to import:
You will need to step up the BIOS and iDRAC together

Thanks for the pictures. OMSA seems to be reporting the memory are having no issue. To delete the logs, you can access to iDRAC via Ctrl-E: https://dell.to/3iFbxTZ
 
Try clearing the logs, it may help to clear the error. Since the system is able to detect all of the memory and if the error still pop ups, you can ignore the error message, as it might be a system bug issue. I wouldn't want to suggest to dig deeper into clearing BIOS and do more troubleshooting, this might brick the system instead of using it. 
 
By the way, PowerEdge T610 does not fully compatible to support Windows Server 2016. It's not a verified OS by engineering.

"I have a T410 with I bought with a single E5504 processor and 2x2GB RAM.I would like to run it with 64GB so I bought four 16GB memory modules: Micron 16GB 2RX4 PC3L-12800R.According to the following document this should be supported, if configured for Optimizer mode in the BIOS.https://dl.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_ser_stor_net/esuprt_poweredge/poweredge-t410_user's%...I have changed the BIOS setting (after I remembered it the first time booting failed with four modules) and I can boot the server with two of these installed (in A1 and A2) - the BIOS says that the RAM is running at 800MHz and I understand that to be a limitation of the CPU. But if I install all four modules, or even just three (in A1, A2, A3) the server appears not to boot - it sits at ""Configuring memory, please wait."" I haven't left it for hours to get past that, could it be that that's what I need to do?I'm wondering if this might also be a limitation of the processor. But the processor spec page seems to indicate that it supports three memory channels and much more than the 64GB I have.Some clarifications:I took out the modules which were in A1 and A2 and put in there the ones which were in A3 and A4. The machine still boots. So it does not seem that the issue is a faulty module.All firmware is at the latest version, to the best of my knowledge - with the exception of the BMC (BIOS is at 1.14).Does anyone have an idea what the issue might be?Thanks



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","It turns out that my previous messages were on the right track. There was damage to the CPU socket, fortunately not of the replace-the-motherboard variety.I ordered a pair of CPUs (as I thought I could at least use all four DIMMs by putting two on each CPU). When I installed the first CPU I noticed something not quite right in the socket but ignored it at that point. Here's what I saw (I have circled the problem): But with the second CPU installed I was getting E1410 errors and the machine wouldn't boot so I had to take everything apart again and investigate. When I looked more closely I realised that this pin was out of place (I'm not sure if it was bent or just caught on the neighbouring pin) but I managed to get it back from the red position to the green position.That didn't solve my dual-CPU issue but I found that with one CPU, it would now see all 64GB, which it had not done before. So the original memory issue was apparently due to that pin above.Ultimately (for anyone who is interested) I did resolve the E1410 error - I think what did it was cleaning the second CPU socket by dabbing with a tissue moistened with isopropyl alcohol as Intel or Dell documentation mentions somewhere. As of now the machine boots with two L5640s and 64GB RAM (16GB in each of A1, A2, B1, B2), and I hope it will remain stable.

For NON booting GPT works fine with windows vista 7 8 10.

BIOS that meets the UEFI 2.3.1 specifications provides the following benefits:

Ability to support Windows 10 security features like Secure Boot, Microsoft Defender Credential Guard, and Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard. All require UEFI firmware.
Faster boot and resume times.
Ability to more easily support large hard drives (more than 2 terabytes) and drives with more than four partitions.

"Hello,I've reached the end of my rope trying to figure this out since I'm pretty new to what I'm dealing with. I've been after this for several days and I have no idea how to accomplish this.I'm used to the old school way of having to create DOS boot disks and whatnot to update firmware, but I haven't done any for years. I came into some ""luck"" and got a big case of white box Intel branded X710 quad port adapters. What I need is to update the firmware as they are quite old. I have the Intel firmware downloaded and it apparently runs from what is called an ""EFI Shell"".I do not have an EFI boot manager in any of my menus (not that I can find anyway) in order to use this utility. Iv'e tried using the utilities where you browse for a file on USB, but it doesn't like this file (nvmupdate64e.efi) for whatever reason and it just kicks me back out every time I select it. It appears that the functions I am trying to use is only for Dell BIOS updates, I'm just not sure.Can anyone help me with this? I need an explanation of how this works and how to achieve this. Of all the google hits, they all revolve around BIOS updates. I'm really hoping there is a way to do this, I just can't figure it out.



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Your post gave me just enough information to finally figure this out, so thank you.I was misunderstanding how EFI boot works in general (I'm a little bit TOO old school sometimes), and this got me over the final hump. The link was very helpful. I'm just so used to using the easy-button in the lifecycle controller, the non-standard approach was throwing me off.For anyone else reading, if you are trying to do non-Dell device firmware updates such as Intel NIC's in efi file format, go to the link above and get the ""shell.efi"" file, and put in in a directory on your fat32 formatted USB stick like this: /efi/boot/Shell.efi, then rename the file to Boot64.efi. When done, you should have  /efi/boot/Boot64.efi.  In addition, copy any firmware files or programs you may need into a separate directory on the same usb stick for use after you get the shell running.Plugin your USB stick to the machine you are working with and set your BIOS to boot UEFI mode, then on post, press F11 to enter the one shot UEFI boot manager. Once there, select your USB stick from the list, and the machine should boot into the EFI shell from the USB stick. After that, just google for the commands that the EFI shell will accept.Those were my steps used on R730, R730XD,, and R620 equipment. Also to note, I tried using the remote mapping of the USB stick using the iDRAC virtual media and updated 2 units remotely and it works fine. Just keep in mind that in the F11 boot menu, the ""virtual floppy"" will be the device you select as there will be no remote USB in the list. I would also not try to update firmware remotely unless you have a rock-solid and reliable network connection... any interruption in the flashing process can and probably will render the device dead.Thanks again Martin!

This kind of behavior is expected when using drives that are not certified by Dell due to communication mismatch with the controller firmware. It is just a chance that they may(not) operate normally. Consider purchasing a Dell certified drive as a replacement drive.

"Good afternoon,I am looking for a compatible PSU for a  PowerEdge T430.  I have 2 PSU's new, one is a 0N24MJ (495W) and a 02FR04 (495W).   My research indicates these are both compatible, but I wanted to confirm before traveling on site.  The current PSU's are 495W, but I am unsure of the exact PSU model.  Will these work for a  PowerEdge T430?

N24MJ will not work, as it is a 12 Gen PSU which is only for T420. As for 2FR04, it is indeed compatible with T430.

"hi
we purchased 6 servers from dell india. 
we are facing a severe heating issue on top of the chassis above the raid card with all these 6 servers.
server configuration
R420 - single hexcore processor 2.2 ghz, 32gb ram
4 X 600 gb 15000 rpm drives(configured as 2 drives in raid 1 + 2 drives in raid 1)
these servers are placed in a datacenter -- temperature is around 18 deg C
we are facing a severe heating issue at the on top of the chasiss just above the raid controller
when the servers are placed one above the other like they are normally placed in a datacenter the servers heat up between 50.4 - 57 deg celcius
dell support has changed motherboard, raid card , power supply etc of one of the above servers which is non-production (heating to 50.4 deg celcius) but the issue is not resolved
On closer examination of the raid controller card i noted that the fins of the heatsink on top of the raid controller card --  instead of being parallel to the airflow is actually perpendicular to the air flow and is actually trapping all the heat
the same card in a R620 server has the heatsink fins parallel to the air flow which remains cool
has anybody else in this forum noted this and are facing such a heating issue ?
could you please check this and let me know the resolution to this problem
can the heatsink be turned around by 90 degrees so that the fins of the heat sink are parallel to the airflow ?
thanks for your help

					Go to Solution.","the dset report displays normal temperatures since it measures the inlet temperature (26-28 deg C) and the cpu temperature (57-62 degC).
The server is working as intended. There is nothing to fix. This has been reported before and we have investigated it. Our 12th generation servers had a massive overhaul with thermal and acoustic design. Because of this the chassis can get hot to the touch at the rear of the system, but it poses no risk to system components.
You can change the default fan control to increase air flow and reduce the exhaust temperature, but this will increase noise and electricity usage. Go into the iDRAC - iDRAC Settings>Thermal. Change the User Option to Fan Speed Offset and set the Fan Speed Offset to High Fan Speed Offset.

"Hello,I've previously purchased a PowerEdge T550, but opted to leave off the BOSS-S2 module at build time. Now that I've been running the system for a few months, I am working on reconfiguring how some of my drives are arranged - and plan to pass through the RAID controller and an HBA to a storage-focused VM. It seems the cleanest way to move the hypervisor out into its own separate controller (to avoid passthrough to the VM) would be to add the BOSS-S2 module. Looking at the parts available from the support page, I found the following: Dell BOSS-S2 Controller Card without Cable Dell 480GB SSD M2 SATA 6GB/s 512e Hard Drive - Single Stick I wanted to confirm a few things here before I put in the order:Is this BOSS-S2 card the same that would have come with the T550 originally? Looking at the manual, I see it slots in to a bay on the front. As there's no picture, it's hard to tell if it is the same one.The BOSS-S2 listing mentions ""without cable"". Is there a separate cable item I need to purchase? Is the cabling already present in the T550? I don't see a listing for ""BOSS-S2 Controller Card with Cable"".  Is the M.2 SSD I listed compatible with the BOSS-S2?I am working on the assumption that the BOSS-S2 will show up as a separate disk controller. Is that accurate? Thanks a lot in advance for any help. - Clay

"Hi there,
Trying to figure out my power consumption of servers with respect of installing a new AC unit and potentially adding a battery pack on UPS. By no means do I consider myself an electrician so I would value your input.
I am basing my calculations of this article where in essense the formula is: Equipment BTU = Total wattage for all  		equipment x 3.5
Q: Is it safe to assume that if a server has dual power supply to double the wattage used?

Grand Total Wattage:

Total BTU needed:
32252.5



1 Ton of cooling = 12K BTUs roughly needing a 2.6 Ton AC unit.
Does this sounds right? Your thoughts?
Granted I am not including the room size etc. but I just wanted to make sure that I am calculating the consumption of servers correctly. I have also read that these are just starting numbers and that number of disks in raid and memory sticks in server will draw more power...something as adding 10W per per disk/memory stick...is this true??

Best to find the circuit at the breaker box, remove cover, and clamp on one of the circuit legs off the breaker. I would leave it connect for a day , monitor it for peak power consumption. You will need to get lighting power consumption figured into the total, and heat gain through wall/floor/ceiling/door.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hi Kimleng Vey,
The error that you are receiving  “the iDRAC is not ready. The configuration values cannot be accessed” is a communication error with the iDRAC. Try to reset the iDRAC and see if it becomes responsive. On the R720 the easiest way to do this is to hold down the i button on the front of the server for more than 15 seconds, this will do a soft reboot of the iDRAC. If the iDRAC is still not responsive after you do this please power off the server and unplug it for about a minute, while it is unplugged hold the power button in for 10 seconds, this will drain any power from the system so that the iDRAC powers off fully. Once this is done reconnect power to the system and see if the iDRAC is accessible.
Was the iDRAC working previously?

(BIOS_VXY4H_LN64_1.3.3.BIN)In the testing I'm doing, the update looks like it's going through ok, but then displaysTargetCompareState=Before prompting to reboot. On reboot, the BIOS doesn't update.If I try and update in an automated fashion by running BIOS_VXY4H_LN64_1.3.3.BIN -qr  the system appears to lock up, before (I think) the watchdog timer kicks in and does a reboot.If I extract the 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 BIOS files and compare the contents, I can see that the BiosVerifyLinux.bin file is missing from the 1.3.3 bundle. Not sure if that is part of the issue.Any pointers welcome...Cheers,Rob

"Dear Sir or Madam,I have bought the Poweredge R730 w/ Single E5-2640 V4 (10C/20T) with 750W 80+ Platinum PSU config and perform well. Now I wish to add the GPU card for extended processing performance, eg.

Those I need to inquire you on: should I have to order the GPU Installation Kit or any part to ensure the custom configuration gets into work (optional 2x GPU should be concerned).

An issue you may run into is that the specific GPU isn't supported, and may not function. The supported GPU list for the R730 is below;



R730 GPUs supported at RTS


Nvidia
AMD
Intel Phi




Nvidia K80
AMD S9150
Intel Phi 7120P


Nvidia M60
AMD S7150
Intel Phi 3120P


Nvidia M40
AMD S7150x2



Nvidia K40M
AMD S/W9100



Nvidia GRID K1





Nvidia GRID K2




Now so you know, the R730 can support two 300W, full-length, double-wide or four 150W, single width GPUs. The GPUs are installed on the PCIe x16 Gen3 interfaces available on Riser2 and the GPU-Optional Riser3. For installing two internal GPUs in the system, GPU-Optional Riser3 has to be present.
It also looks like the cables will be GPU specific as well.

Would you confirm if you indeed ordered an OEMR T550, or was it to be a T550? I ask as OEMRs are purchased on a reduced cost on the OEM purchase program. Also you can't take an OEMR system back to Dell branded, so if it was intended to be an OEMR type it won't have the things you are looking at.
So, if it was ordered incorrectly, or you received the wrong system type, you should work with your account team to get it RMA'd, as support won't have the same ability.

You won't be able to walk the iDrac back that far, what you would have to do is walk the BIOS back up to current, as you can't just update to the current version from that far back without bricking the motherboard. So you would need to walk the BIOS up without skipping more than 2 or 3 at a time, or anything marked Urgent.
 
Also, if you have access to the iDrac web interface, I would suggest exporting the iDrac license in case there is any issue then you have it available to restore.

"First-time poster here, after exhausting all my googling abilities I am stuck. I have an R820 that I received second hand and it appears that the backplane was never used by its first owner, as none of the power/signal/SAS cables were connected, and the bays were all filled with blanks. The server would boot and run fine off a USB flash drive, but when attempting to connect a RAID card and make use of the backplane I continuously get stuck on the Initializing Firmware Interfaces screen.  Looking in the idrac logs the following exception occurs around the time in which the server appears to hang. In an attempt to remedy the issue I tried first removing the raid card, which allowed the system to boot normally. Replacing the generic raid card with an H200A yielded the same results as the other card, and the H200A was pulled from a working system moments before in an attempt to isolate the issue.  Furthermore, this only happens when the raid card is connected and a logical disk is configured. Destroying the array and attempting to boot allows the system to post and boot fine. I'm at my wits end on this one, as I can't figure out why a healthy raid array would cause a system hangup like this. All firmware is current to my knowledge, the lifecycle controller does not report any updates available. I unfortunately don't have any extra hardware to test with beyond what I have already done.  I have tried fully resetting the system to factory defaults using the built-in method on the lifecycle controller, as well as continuously trying to change settings and power cycling the system to see if I could find any conflicts within the BIOS. Another weird artifact I found during the process was that when trying to boot in UEFI mode, the raid configuration utility will never be loaded. Upon requesting the array config utility during startup, I get a message stating that the utility will load after firmware initialization is complete, but after initializing I get dumped straight into the boot sequence.  Happy to post any further explanations/logs/photos upon request. Any help is greatly appreciated!

I assume H200A is a PERC card that was tried to isolate the issue, the PE R820 is compatible with Series 8 Family PERC Controllers, whereas the H200A falls under the 6 & 7 series PERC controllers.
 
Please try the installation procedure using one of the following RAID controllers H310, H710, H710P, and H810.

You are correct. You would need iDRAC Service Module or  OpenManage Server Administrator installed in the OS to configure the parameters.

Automatic System Recovery
 
Automatic System Recovery feature is a hardware-based timer, which is used to reset the server in the event of a hardware failure. You can perform automatic system recovery operations such as reboot, power cycle, or power off after a specified time interval. This feature is enabled only when the operating system watchdog timer is disabled. If OpenManage Server Administrator is installed, this monitoring feature is disabled to avoid duplicate watchdog timers.
 
You can configure three parameters in this feature from iDRAC interfaces:
 
    Watchdog state: The default state is enabled when OMSA is not present, and when BIOS or OS watchdog timer is disabled.
    Watchdog timeout: The default value is 480 seconds. The minimum value is 60 seconds and the maximum value is 720 seconds.
    Watchdog timeout Recovery Action or Auto Recovery Action: The actions can be Powercycle, Power Off, Reboot or None.

"So as I was able to find, installing GPUs will require the riser and the kit and the whole nine yards.I got the 1100W PSUs, I updated bios, updated iDRAC to latest versions.Installed GPU and used the riser power cable to do it. I enable power to the machine and there it is, blinking amber light. If I disconnect the power from the GPU, even without completely removing it, the system works just fine. Power back to GPU? Machine won't even start. iDRAC is still accessible through the network but that's about it, it just refuses to boot and nothing regarding the issue shows on any logs. When I go to power configuration, the system is capped at 461 watts for some reason. The input wattage is over 1200w and output (of PSUs) is 1100w. There is more than enough for them to work properly. Why is power capped at 461 when I have two 1100W PSUs? I reset iDRAC to default twice and it is still capped at 461 and the machine refuses to boot only when GPU power is connected.

"From Dell-DylanJ's response in this link: https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/Video-card-on-dell-r730xd/td-p/7306384...it appears that the R730 (well R730XD) should be OK with a Quadro K1200. However, I have tried installing one in the X16 slot (slot 4) in a Dell R730 and consistently get a PCIe link training failure error for that slot on boot. Both BIOS and iDRAC are on the latest versions. I'm slightly at a loss as to how to update the PCIe device firmware (suggested further down the error message) if I can't get the server to recognise the card in the first place.The card doesn't have any additional power ports and recommends a 200W power supply (the server has 750W supplies), so I am assuming (perhaps wrongly) that the GPU upgrade kit is not required.Any suggestions as to what I am doing wrong much appreciated. (The card is intended for use in a ESXi v6.5 VMWARE client on the machine.) Many thanks.   



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Aw5585,
 
The reason you're seeing the training error is that while the R730xd supports the Quadro K1200, the R730 doesn't.
The R730 does look to support the Quadro P5000 (p/n# 00MKC) and M5000 (p/n# Y1P3V) models though.
 
Let me know if this helps.

"We have a Dell PowerEdge FC630 server that is not wanting to cooperate. It houses a VMWare ESXi Host. Last week, the host migrated all of the VMs to other Hosts, and was inaccessible within VSphere. We rebooted the blade in hope that would correct the issue. The issue we are now facing is that during the boot process, the server is asking for a password. After much reading and researching, I think this to be a setup password of some kind. Unfortunately, this server was configured well before my time and I apparently do not have this password. I've tried many, many different ones I thought it could be to no avail. Default passwords included (calvin). Here is the screenshot of where the iDrac Virtual Console is asking for the password:I have read in the manual that a password can be removed by moving the jumper on the system board from pins 1 and 2 to 2 and 3, although I am unsure if this will reset that password in the screenshot. I tried this, but after putting the sled back in the chassis and booting it, the server never fully booted back up. I waited probably 10-15 minutes for the power button to stop flashing green before powering it off, moving the jumper back to the original pins, and booting it. The server did power back on and I was able to get to the iDrac again, but it still prompting for this password.We are working on gaining support for the server blade, but until then, I figured I would see if anyone had more information that could be useful to this issue.Last resort would be to reset the blade and reinstall the VMWare Host, but we are really trying to keep from having to do that.Thanks in advance if anyone has any ideas or recommendations!

Yes, if you supply credentials to that URL it will show the BASIC Auth string in the packet and you ""could"" decode the credentials that way, but there is not a use case for someone accessing that URL in a browser, and in order to actually decode the credentials it would have to be done within that specific environment.

If you have a supported RAID controller then you can put the drives to another server with similar controller and get the virtual disk imported. Once drive are inserted on new controller, drives will be detected as foreign drives. You can import foreign configuration to get the virtual disk visible on new server

"I have a T410 which I bought to use as a homelab/home server.It had very old firmware and I have managed to upgrade the important things to the latest versions: BIOS/iDRAC/Lifecycle Controller (and a couple of other things).Before I started upgrading I was able to do hardware diagnostics from the UCS.As part of my upgrade process I tried installing the diagnostics package from this page:https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=2mm6jThe machine is still quite stripped down (no disks and only 4GB RAM). I was doing my installations from the Support Live Image (2.2). Some firmware I could install that way but the diagnostics installation failed with the following message:Update Failure: Partition Failure - Attach partition has failedI also got this message when trying to upgrade the Lifecycle Controller and I resolved that by installing the UCS package via iDRAC. If I'm not mistaken the installation attempt above messed up the System Services and I had to install the UCS package again.So right now I have working iDRAC and Lifecycle Controller but no built-in hardware diagnostics. I was considering leaving the machine without the diagnostics system. But I had intended to run the diagnostics before putting the computer into use. Will I be missing much? How might I be able to get this installed? Do I need to install Windows and run the installation from there? Do I need more RAM?Tips will be appreciated! Thanks!



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","I solved this by booting the machine into Windows 10. The W64 version of the diagnostics install worked successfully, and then I ran the W64 package to reinstall the Lifecycle Controller, and it seems from the date on the list in the Platform Update section that that installed the diagnostics too (the same version).

If you perform a transfer of ownership to get the server registered to you then you may be able to recover the license. Once the transfer of ownership is complete you can contact customer care and request the registration code to add the license to your digital locker. Once it is in your digital locker you can download it whenever you like.
Transfer of ownership requires account verification of the current registered owner, so it is intended to be performed by the current owner. If you are unable to get the seller to perform the transfer or you don't know the required information to fill out the transfer of ownership, the transfer may be denied.

The biggest issue is that you will have to replace the processors, the riser boards, and possibly some of the expansion cards. The technical differences between the boards are significant and not worth the expense of replacing most of the internal hardware to accept the III gen board.

"Hello everyone and sorry for any grammar errors, not my primary language and this is kinda edge case so please bear with me As title says -  my machines suffered from a ball lightning damage. Long story short - i managed to fix most of the damaged stuff, and replaced the cheap-ish equipment. Due financial reasons i currently cannot afford to buy another motherboard for the T610, on top on that there is none available anywhere within reasonable distance near me.I do however have the equipment and skills to fix it. After some fiddling around i managed to bring it back to life by removing the integrated nic IC (the bcm5709cc0kpbg chip got toasted as expected and it was shorting the MB).  While diagnosing the machine i had to do the minimal boot attempt several times, and after all other stuff got properly detected (all ram modules, the two cpus etc) after POST i get ""PCIe Training Error: Embedded NIC1"". All of the solutions i found online assume there's some pcie problems / incompatible hardware, but in my case it's obvious that the chip is not there. Is there any way i can boot the machine without the integrated NIC ?I have some options, like plug a random broadcom lan card into the PCIe and pray, or probably buy a PCIe card with the same chip, remove it from the card, ball it and replace it on the MB, but that's something I'd like to avoid at near-all cases, because I'm fairly sure there's other damages from the lightning (as expected). Any advice (apart from ""just buy another mb"") are more than welcome , and thank you in advance!

"Lifecycle Controller: v2.81.81.81Bios: v2.13.0Intel x710: v20.0.17HelloHaving installed an Intel 10G X710 rNDC (#68m95), the Lifecycle controller is failing with a critical error ""SUP0528"" (Unable to generate a firmware comparison table). According to the resources, this is an internal error and restarting the process does not clear the fault. Reflashing the iDrac firmware does not resolve the fault. Updates are taking place via the F10 lifecycle controller and connected via HTTPS to download the catalog. Catalog downloads but the proces fails on the subsequent step.The fault is reproduceable. A second R630 with an identical configuration, additional x710 and all updated firmware levels gives the same result. Removing the x710 card and attempting the update process however succeeds.It appears the Lifecycle controller fails with this NDC installed. Can Dell confirm please?RgdsPops



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","@DELL-Joey C, @DELL-Marco B, hiProblem identified and solved. However, for the life of me i cannot understand why.Both the 4P 10G x710 cards (68M95) were new. They were installed at the same time in both R630 units. Both Lifecycle controllers we then run independently for updates and both gave the same SUP0528 critical error. Installing the same rNDC NIC into a third R530 to serve as a testbed gave the same results. Initial suspicions were conflicts with other hardware but this did not turn out to be the case in subsequent tests. Attention was turned back to the rNDC card.Up until now, neither of the two rNDC NICs were used operationally. They were connected to the mainboard and powered up but no actual data was passed through the ports. Having then connected one of the four SFP ports to our switches and enabled it, inexplicably, the Lifecycle controller now does not flag the critical error. Turning to the second server and enabling a port on the second rNDC NIC and the precisely the same behaviour occurred.It seems that once the lifecycle controller downloaded the online catalog and proceeded to interrogate the hardware, it may have been reading a value from the x710 daughtercards that it did not expect - perhaps a register or a count (for data throughput, say). Whatever it is was cleared the moment traffic was flowing through the cards. Cold booting both units and the Lifecycle controller is able to now continue through to the firmware listing table.A very odd behaviour and one that was quite unexpected. It may be helpful to Teir 2 support or if this is passed on to the engineers. I am unsure how common this is with other x710 variants but there is evidently something with the Lifecycle firmware that it did not like until the rNDC cards were 'used'.CheersPops

Having this enabled, prevents anybody from reading /dev/mem, which is why the update fails. If I turn Secure Boot off, the update applies successfully.Obviously this is a poor workaround from a security perspective, and it also means that I have to reboot the server to disable Secure Boot.Hopefully Dell will be able to provide a new command line firmware update utility that will work without needing to disable Secure Boot.

The drive can report smaller if it was configured that way, without using the whole drives space.

Would you clarify what specific device you are trying to update? I ask as the platform specific ISO's for the 14th generation were mostly pulled due to demoted content, as seen here. I know you were using the ISO when you used DRM, but have you tried to assemble and create the ISO just from the individual updates? If so you may want to try that path, and attempt it without using the contents of the ISO. 
Another thing to consider is if you have secure boot enabled, as it isn't supported with this process.
 
Let me know how it goes.

This is ether a hardware failure (maybe the card is faulty). Can you check the card in a different hardware? Or maybe it is a compatibility problem. And this GPU is not working, maybe it's not validated or maybe it is not working propperly.

					Go to Solution.","Hello TeslaTec,
 
Has any hardware been added or removed, or firmware updated, when this occurred?
In the iDRAC where you see the bus fatal error; Is there an entry near it that indicates a slot number?
 
 
Initial troubleshooting steps I can recommend:
*Flea power drain, test results
*Clear NVRAM, test results
*Minimum to POST configuration testing
 
 
drain flea power (shut down, disconnect power cables and Network cables, hold in power button 20 seconds with cords removed).  After flea power drain, system has to set for 3 minutes for DRAC to reset without any power plugged in, then plug in NIC and power but wait 2 minutes before power on to give DRAC time to initialize.
 
Clear NVRAM - there is a map under the lid to show the jumper location. Shut down,  Set jumper to the Clear position, power on and Post up to the jumper error, shut down and return to original location.
 
 
Minimum to post  (this is minimum components to POST, it won't boot, this is to test POST. If successful POST, put things back a little at a time until find faulting component)
 
The minimum components to allow the Dell PowerEdge R520 to complete POST are as follows:
 
*System Board
*CPU1 with heat sink (if no POST try with other CPU in CPU1 socket)
*Single DIMM configuration with DIMM in socket A1 (if no POST try a different DIMM in A1)
*Control Panel with cable
*Expansion Riser
*PSU (and for redundant PSU also the PDB/PIB)
 
Remove anything not on that list: DVD, Hard drives, PERC controller, backplane, network card, NIC cable, any pcie cards, keyboard, mouse, USB devices, ….  anything not on the list remove.
 
If it does not post then the issue is with one of those components.
If you get successful POST, put things back a little at a time until you find the faulting component.
 
 
When you can get into the function keys try run diagnostics and Update iDRAC and BIOS firmware:
 
Firmware  update:
IDRAC version: 2.60.60.60  (should be iDRAC: 2.65.65.65), Bios version: 2.1.2 (should be BIOS: 2.9.0)
When you can try to update the them : https://dell.to/3uT5HF8
 
 
For BIOS recommend to step up to BIOS 2.9.0 https://dell.to/3uRVSYa
Do the ones with > in my list:
Version         Release Date         Importance
>2.9.0        24 Mar 2020        Urgent
>2.7.0         19 Sep 2019         Urgent
>2.6.0         28 Jun 2018         Urgent
>2.5.1         07 Mar 2018         Urgent

2.1.3         04 Jun 2014         Recommended
2.1.2         03 Mar 2014         Recommended
Look for  Other Available Versions at the bottom of the page to see previous version you need.
 
 
To run diagnostics:
Boot to  F11 on Dell Splash screen, selecting  Boot Manager -> System Utilities -> Launch Dell Diagnostics.  Note any messages and continue testing.

"Dear Dell
I am getting misinformation from your sales staff in Hong Kong. I am a corporate (education) customer and I just bought a PowerEdge R650. Simply, I want to add M.2 NVME drives which are standard and easy to find nowadays to my machine.

In addition to the product taking six months to arrive, the staff did not understand the difference between an M2 and M2 NVMe drive thus selling me a BOS card which I didn't need. So I bought hard drives to use it, fine.
They did not make available to me the rearbay option during the sales process.
They told me over the phone that my cutting edge server won't support M.2 NVME, only 2.5 inch NVME. This is unfathomable.
Now, they refuse to sell me the rear bay, going so far (and I have email to prove this) that indicates they believe the Poweredge R650 cannot install rear bay SSDs. It clearly plainly can from the documentation and from the Poweredge website in the US that there is a rear bay that supports 2.5 x 2 NVME drives.  
They cannot answer simple questions like where the Rearbay will go, can you use a rear bay and a boss card at the same time. I have asked this over email.
When I asked to buy rear bay for nvme drives. they instead show me M.2 sized Nvme drives, which contradicts the statement made over the phone. 

They refuse to provide a quote, despite me simply asking for the rearbay configuration. 
This has gone on for weeks. They are slow to respond, do not call back, and do not communicate clearly. I understand HK is not the biggest market for corporate servers, but it is impossible to reach Dell's support staff in the US for very simple basic questions.

					Go to Solution.","Yes... M.2 is very popular in PeeCee'isch like devices like Workstation, OfficePC and Laptops or PS5 
Just grab the first PCIe card which you can get and try it.
Note: Server normaly use fan less PCIe devices without active cooling because when its a CARD from the server vendor the inventory holds voltage and cooling information so that the server fans can deliver propper colling.If you use 3rd. party stuff expect different behaviour or just chosse a different performance profile.

For SC1435, pressing the ""i"" button would just blink the blue identification, it is only for identifying. Could you try press and hold the same ""i"" button to check if there is any indication of error code. 
 
Try removing all the components of the server except for these below. Then try turning on the server. 

System board.
Processor (with heatsink) in socket 1.
One stick of memory in slot 2.
One power supply.
Control panel (to turn on system).
PCI riser.

If the steps above fails, unfortunately, there is nothing much I can think of to try on any steps to revive the server.

"I've recently deployed the Openmanage Enterprise virtual appliance to manage our servers. It seems to work reasonbably OK with the newer (13G) ones (with a few issues), but barely seems to work at all with the one 11G model (R710) which I still have - it can't see its DNS name, and doesn't seem able to check it for firmware updates. Is this expected behaviour? I realise that the 11G server is quite old now so that may well be the reason.All of the servers have iDRAC Enterprise licenses.Thanks

					Go to Solution.","OMEnt has limited support for 11g systems. 11g systems are reliant on OpenManage Server Administrator as an agent. The iDRAC6 has limited capabilities as an agent in comparison to later generations.
OpenManage Essentials is designed to use OMSA as an agent. OpenManage Enterprise is designed to use iDRACs as agents. If you are going to be managing 11th generation or older systems then you will probably want to use OME instead of OMEnt.

2) Turn server off and back on using the power button, or

"Hey guys,I have a Poweredge R240 and unfortunately, one day, the fans randomly ramped up to 100% speed and never went back down. I also noticed a dialog that stated ""Ubuntu noticed a problem with a fwupd."" A couple of dialogs came up that said there were some problems. These seem to be software or firmware related. I attempted to set the fan control to low from IDRAC settings to no aveil. My next idea was to run the hardware diagnostics tool, I expected it to be like the Windows troubleshooter, but to my surprise it actually found some problems with the fans! I believe it might be a faulty temperature sensor causing the issue because I used lmsensors to get some temps, and everything was normal (32-34C). I attempted to disconnect the problem fan, but the fan speed stayed on 100%. I opened the case to see all 3 fans operating at 100% properly. From the pictures below, you can see that the server believes that the fans in slot 1 and 2 are not connected, but they are connected and running at 100% speed, it seems that it only detects fan 3.My question is: is there a temperature sensor embedded in the fan or is it seperate? How can I fix this issue?  Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading. Ubuntu 20 LTS Dell Poweredge R240Bios 1.2.0 (old)

"Please Can you help to know if I Can Install an external VGA card to Dell Power Edge T 610 ?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","The T610 only has PCIe 4x slots (not open-ended from what I've seen, so you cannot put in a 'larger' PCIe card either).
This means that physically you can put in a 1x or 4x PCIe card. However, Dell's server bios isn't really built around the idea that you'd add a videocard (that's more for a desktop computer). You may be able to get it to work, but don't count on support or assistance from Dell.
A few notes: 
- there is most likely no power cable for a videocard in the server, so your videocard would need to be a model that doesn't require extra power.
- if you have a DRAC, depending on the model DRAC, you'll loose (part of) it's functionality
- you may or may not be able to disable the onboard videocard. This could cause a conflict or prevent the add-on card from working.
If you're looking for a Dell tower system with dual processor support, I'd suggest to get a Precision Workstation T5500 or T7500. These are built to hold videocards and can handle dual processor and lots of memory. They are also available with a PERC6i (or at least the T7500 is) for full raid support. The only thing these workstations don't have is support for more than 4 harddrives (w/o sacrificing an optical drive bay) and hotswap capabilities.

"Hiya,The dedicated iDrac port on my R720 has suddenly stopped working (no lights or traffic). I have currently set iDrac to one of the LOMs, so that I can at least have access to the system.After opening up the server, I see that the port is built onto the motherboard, which means replacing it is out of the question. So my question is;Can I buy a separate iDrac 7 card (the 2827M) and use it as a dedicated NIC for iDrac and if so, will it be able to power the system on and off without the server being on?Alternatively, can I get an idrac9 card and use it for the same purpose. I'll have to upgrade my license if so, which is not a huge deal. Here are the screenshots of my system

"Hi,
We have a DELL R910 server (Service Tag:<ADMIN NOTE: Service tag removed per privacy policy>) and have read some articles here about the problem ""E1234 Memory Riser Power Failure"" .  We have done some of the suggested troubleshooting.  On our system, here's what we've done so far:
1.  Reseat the Memory Riser G and its DIMMs.  Same problem encountered.
2,  Cleaned the Slot and contacts of the riser for any dusts or dirt.  Same problem encountered.
3.  Swapped Memory Riser from  C with that of from G slot.  Same problem encountered (the problem is still on Memory Riser G slot)
4.  Removed the Memory Riser from slot G so there's no Memory Riser installed on slot G.  Same problem encountered (the problem is still on Memory Riser G slot)

So it seems that slot G on the System board unit have a problem.  I haven't replaced the system board unit yet (will be waiting for replacement).  Is there any other way to make this server boot up as we need this one badly.  Can we just disable slot G and place the Memory Riser on the other slot allocated to that CPU? (Note: we have 4 CPUs, so we have 2 slots of Memory Risers per CPU)

Regards,
Paolo



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Paw0702,

Did the error happen to start during a power up or while it was running normally? If it did it on power up then we can try the following procedure to clear the issue.

1.       Power off the system if it is not already powered off
2.       Remove AC cord, wait for standby voltage to dissipate (10-20 secs or no LEDs visible and no LCD illumination)
3.       Remove the G memory riser identified by the E1234 
4.       Check the memory riser for any damaged components. Also, make sure the heat sink clip is installed correctly. Then leave the riser out of the system until step 10)    
5.       Install a jumper on pins 5-6 of the jumper block labeled “J_DBGCPLD1” which is located near the iSCSI key connector (which looks like a phone jack) as seen below. There isn’t a jumper installed on this block from the factory, so you will need to borrow one from the  NVRAM_CLR/PASS_EN block or get it externally.

7.       Apply AC.  Wait ~45 seconds to a minute for the iDRAC to be initialized. The front LCD will flicker momentarily and you can see the LCD interactive when it is initialized. The power fault message will be cleared from the LCD message queue.   
8.       Remove AC, wait for standby voltage to dissipate (10-20 secs or no LEDs visible and no LCD illumination)
9.       Remove the jumper (if you borrowed from the NVRAM_CLR/PASS_EN block, make sure it is replaced in the proper position) 
10    . Reinstall memory riser
11.    Apply AC
12.    Power up the system 

Let me know if that resolves the issue.

You can do this with the H710's Replace Member function. You can manually replace any physical disk that is part of a virtual disk using the Replace Member functionality.
Perform the following steps to replace a physical disk:
1. In the Virtual Disk Management window, select Virtual Disk # and press the down-arrow key until Physical Disks is highlighted.
2. Press the right-arrow key to expand the list of physical disks that are members of the virtual disk.
3. Press the down-arrow key and highlight the desired physical disk you want to replace. Press <F2> to expand the list of allowed operations on the disk.
4. Select Replace and then Start.
5. Press the down-arrow to highlight a replacement disk and then press the spacebar to select the disk.
6. Select OK to start the replacement.
NOTE: The replacement disk must be a hot spare or an unconfigured disk without a foreign configuration. It must have the same or greater capacity and should be of the same type as the disk it is replacing.
Restrictions and limitationsThe following restrictions and limitations apply to the Replace Member operation:
• The Replace Member functions are restricted to one per array for RAID 0, RAID 1, and RAID 5, and two per array for RAID 6.
• The Replace Member function and rebuild cannot run simultaneously on a RAID 6 virtual disk. The rebuild operation has a higher priority, and the Replace Member operation is aborted if a rebuild begins.
• The Replace Member function and rebuild cannot run simultaneously on a RAID 6 virtual disk. The rebuild operation has a higher priority, and the Replace Member operation is aborted if a rebuild begins.

"Hi,I have m1000e chassis with 4 M620 blades. 2 were running for a year, I have added two more now.Those two newly added I equipped with 2x E5 2680 v2 + 4 x udimm 8GB.They are stuck on ""Configuring memory..."" both, the same.I thought maybe memory issue/incompatibility, I replaced RAM with ones already working in previous 2 servers -> result sameThen I removed cpus and I have installed just one CPU and ""new"" memory, but just one in A1 slot -> server worksI was happy.I did full update of firmware, BIOS 2.9.0, Idrac 2.65.65.65 and so on. I thought my problems are gone.I installed again two CPUs (E5 2680 v2) + memory A1, B1 -> again ""Configuring memory...""Then I thought, maybe second CPU issue, I put second CPU in slot 1 -> it works, so both CPUs are ok if working in slot 1, alone, in single cpu configuration.Then I entered again both CPUs and memory A1, B1 -> again ""Configuring memory..."" So the conclusion is server works when only one CPU installed, when two installed it doesn't. Both CPUs work well in a single CPU configuration, so it shouldn't be a CPU failure. I would say mainboard issue or CPU 2 socket, but why two server blades behave exactly same?Any ideas?Two blades with same mainboard/cpu 2 socket failure? CMC firmware 6.21 - latestSame CPUs 2 x E5 2680v2 I have entered to one of my ""old"" M620 and they work well, memory same as inserted to new blades installed in other blade also work well, so compatibility is not an issue I hope.

Both servers works just fine with RDIMM's 2Rx4.The memory which doesn't work with two 2680 v2 processors works well with older processors, but you don't have guarantuee. So my advise, use officialy supported ones or test and replace with other memory modules if you see same issue.

"Hi,The os/boot drive on my T320 just failed, so I purchased another and swapped them (identical SAS drives).  When I boot up and go to reinstall the OS windows is having a hard time preparing the drive.  It takes a long, long time to partition (300GB drive) and then comes back with the 3 partitions but won't let me install or format the main one.  It will however let me create the partitions again and again - so then I end up with 5, 7, 9 etc - very odd.  All the time there is a beeping sound coming from the server (quiet) but the front panel remains blue.I was able to delete all the partitions and try again, but still no joy.Given that it took upwards of 5 minutes to partition the drive.  Do you think the new drive is faulty or the server or?Sorry for all the vagueness but any help would be much appreciated.Thanks, James.

					Go to Solution.","""Identical"" ... identical model number or identical Dell part number?
If you matched model but it's not a Dell-certified version / firmware, that could explain it.
If you did match the Dell part number (certified firmware), then I'd say it sounds like it may just be a bad drive. You may check the firmware to see if there is an update for it - if super old and your controller has newer firmware (or vice versa, which I would hope wouldn't be the case), then that could also explain it.

"Hey guys!
I picked up an old Poweredge 840 couple months ago from a friend and wanted to tinker with it.
I had it working with windows server 2008 R2 and played around with it. I then took out the raid card since it kept breaking and reinstalled the OS and it worked fine.
I unplugged it and left for a month or so and now when I boots up and posts then it says it needs to enter set-up mode. So I click F2 and it just goes to a black screen. So now I cant boot into windows or get into the bios. 
I've tried removing the CMOS battery and checking the sticks of ram and its still does it. I have no clue why its doing this, it was working fine.

Sorry for the delay. Upon testing it looks like you're trying an invoke-webrequest against just the IP of the iDRAC, where as the iDRAC9 responds and iDRAC8 does not, but you can't really do anything with an invoke-webrequest against the iDRAC IP anyways, so I am not sure the use. 
However, adding /redfish/v1 (root api) does look to work for the iDrac8, for example h t t p s: / ip address / redfish / v1 
Ignore the spacing, I did that so it doesn't get changed by the link shortner.

"Hello, all.
I have a PowerEdge 1900 server (with II on the chassis) that originally had a Xeon 5050 3.00 GHz CPU.
 
Does this server support a Xeon 5080 3.73 GHz CPU?  If so, it would support two of these, correct?
 
Thanks!



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","If it supports one, it will support two.
However, it does not fit within the specifications that Dell has published for supported 5000-series processor specs:
Up to two Dual-Core Intel Xeon 5000 sequence processors at up to 3.0GHz (runs at 3.73GHz)Intel Xeon 5000 Sequence: Dual Independent 667MHz (has 1066MHz)Intel Xeon 5000 Sequence: 2x2MB (OK - has 4MB)
All the above may or may not  make a difference, but to add to that, the 5080 is also a 130W processor, requiring more power than any of the processors that meet the published specs (the X5355 is 120W).  The BIOS updates talk a lot about support being added for newer processors, but those are specifically named as being from the 5100/5200/5300/[5400] family, not the 5000 ... and nothing specifically about support for faster speeds/versions.  Now, that doesn't mean it won't work, just that there is a good chance that it will not.  So, if you have a 5080 to try, are getting one at a price that makes failure an acceptable risk, or have a good return policy, then try it and post what happens.  If not, then I would go to something that is definitely supported and even better than a 5080 (like a X5355).

If you did test with minimum to post components and issue persist then it is one of those components. Likely the system board needs replaced.
If you do have it running fine except the fans that may be the best you can get without replacing the system board.
The Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) controls the fans.  If it is not functioning the system cannot tell how hot things are and default to high.

"Hello,We have a pretty base level T420 server which had a single non-redundant power supply and 4x slot 3.5"" hard drive bay without a backplane.One day the power supply went down due to power surge. Looking online I figured that buying a new single power supply would cost about $500 which did not make sense. At the same time I found a redundant kit with 2 power supplies for a quarter of the price and I got it.When I installed it I found that the redundant power supply kit does not have PSU P4 connector which would be a power for the hard drives and the DVD drive. Instead there is a Backplane Connector (BP) which can't be used at the time.My question: is there any conversion from BP to PSU P4 that I can use? Any ideas?

"Hello.  I'm trying to figure out what is wrong with the PowerEdge 840 that the company I work for has had for the past 14 years.  It has served the company well without issues but right before Christmas it died.  It would keep rebooting and never boot to the OS.  I turned it off, waited and turned back on and would get stuck at ""Strike the F1 key to continue, F2 to run the setup utility"".  I like learning about computers so I volunteered to try and figure out what's wrong (doing so on my own time).  The company ordered a new server and is currently working off a backup.  The company doesn't have an IT person and from my understanding someone came to set up the server and that was it.  I don't know much about servers but would like to learn about them by trying to fix them.  Would greatly appreciate any insight on what's going wrong with this computer, and your time reading my description and questions.  Here's what's going on:When it is just plugged in (not powered on) the green and amber light would alternatingly flash.When it is booting up, Green light would stay on and Amber light would flashI took off the front panel and noticed that while it is booting, the C & D indicator light is amber.  A & B are greenWhile going through the POST process I would see the following:Foreign configuration(s) found on adapter.  Press any key to continue, or 'C' to load the configuration utility1 Logical Drive(s) found on the host adapter.1 Logical Drive(s) Failed1 Logical Drive(s) handled by BIOSIPMI Server Management Configuration Utility 1.5Baseboard Management Controller Revision 1.83Press <Ctrl-E> for BMC Setup within 5 sec.... - Nothing happens when I press Ctrl-EStrike the F1 key to continue, F2 to run the setup utility. - By pressing F1, it just reboots.  When I press F2 I get into BIOS.When I press F2, the IDE Primary Drive 1 is an Unknown Device - Is that because I have a RAID controller? All SATA ports are OffAfter I get into BIOS, on the front panel lights A, B, and C are green, but D would sometimes turn green and sometimes remain amber.  The main amber light is still flashing.  The user's manual for the 840 says an amber D light means that it's an ""other failure"" which does shed too much light on what's going on.If I do a warm reboot by pressing ctrl-alt-del and get into the RAID configuration utility by pressing ctrl+R, the C and D light on the front remains amber, but I'm able to get into the Raid controller utility and see the virtual disk management.  If the amber C & D lights indicate a possible expansion card failure, how would I still be able to get into the RAID controller utility?When I get into the Virtual Disk Management Utility, I see the following:   Which indicates that drives 1 & 4 are bad because they are missing event though they are connected to the cable that connects to the RAID Controller and the virtual disk 0 is in red.Does that mean that since there's a problem with the drives 1 and 4, that all data is now lost?Here are the other pics from the menus.At this point, I don't know what to do.  I don't know much about RAID other than the data is spread through the drives.  I've been reading up on it and supposedly I can remove the bad drive and rebuild the RAID through import, but would it work with 2 drives? I posted in General Hardware because I wanted to make sure my hardware was good before I try and tackle RAID rebuild.Thanks in advance for ANY assistance that can be provided!

					Go to Solution.","Looks like there is no issues with the server. 2 drives failed in RAID 5 resulting virtual disk failure.4 LED on the front indicate boot sequence. LED C and D amber means ""System resource configuration in progress."" It is not a server failure

"Hi all,Yesterday I received warning mail from iDRAC of PowerEdge 610 server about the system board.This is the message:Event: The system board System Level current is greater than the upper critical threshold.Date/Time: Mon Jan 11 2021 06:30:20Severity: CriticalModel: PowerEdge R610Service Tag: xxxxxBIOS version: 6.6.0Hostname: OS Name: iDrac version: 2.90This PowerEdge server is located inside a server room with other PowerEdge Server.

					Go to Solution.","Heya Federico,
 
""I got the same issue with PSU1 in Slot 2"" -> so, it seems that the issue is not related to the PSU itself, but to the connector on the mainboard. It could be that the power distribution fails.
If it is this, a replacement of the mainboard should be considered, as the power distribution unit is directly soldered to the motherboard. There is no separate part for this. If you need a part number, please let me know the systems ServiceTag, simply send it to me via a private message, as there are several to choose from.
 
You're always welcome!

"When I try to update my idrac license using my xml file. I only have the option of Export and Learn More listed in the drop down choices on the Configuration-Licenses page (no import option). Should I factory default/reset the idrac before trying to import it? There was a previous trial license on it that expired long ago. Thanks for any heads up.

"Hello, I'm aware that this server isn't supported anymore, but are there still any catalogs for this model to update? If so, how do I connect to it? I've tried connecting through ftp.dell.com and that just says Network Error. I've also tried downloads.dell.com and that one says 'Downloading Catalog' and then says Network Error.Maybe I've just got it configured wrong but when I click Test Network Connection it says everything passes.I don't know much about this stuff, so I could be going about this the wrong way.Any help is appreciated.

"Hello all, So I am running a Dell Poweredge R430 in it I added a NIC: BRCM 10Gb BASET 2P 57406 Adptr with two slots.First I had an installation of hyper-v server 2016 which recognized both slots of this NIC without any problems.

According to the DCA administrator both lights are blinking so it should be ok. Anybody any ideas what else I can do or what can be wrong? Thanks in advance

The updates you show don't look correct. 
The 2019 Broadcom driver is 21.40.17.70
The 2019 Broadcom Firmware is 21.4.1
Try running those and see if the issue clears up. 
Let me know what you see.

"This is spun off from:https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/PERC-H700-MegaCLI-command/m-p/4597573I have a PowerEdge T310 with a PERC H700 RAID card. it works fine. For example:$ inxi -RD

And since it was published LSI seems to have disappeared and redirects to Broadcomm and Broadcomm pro provide solutions for ""MegaRAID SAS 2108"" and all of it with great Linux support too which rocks.Alas none of it works. That is the provide MegaCLI version 5.3 to 5.5 and I've tried them all and they simply do this:$ /opt/MegaRAID/MegaCli/MegaCli64 -AdpAllInfo -aALL

Even enabling 32bit architecture on the machine does not facilitate a successful conversion. Based on the downloads so far I guess I'm looking forMegaCli-8.01.06-1.noarch.rpmAlas cannot find that at all.Perhaps if I find an actual 32bit Linux OS (perhaps in a VirtualBox) then alien will convert it to a deb.In the mean time I reach out for community support as well.  Basically has anyone got MegaCLI running on Ubuntu 20.04 on a PowerEgde T310 with a PERC H700? Or am I a unique beast?

Honestly considering that many parts of the server affect the power consumption, I can recommend you to calculate this. You can use this EIPT tool to help you choose the R740 from the rack servers and choose the parts from the right side and choose a PSU suitable for balanced power consumption.

"Hi all, i currently run a RAID 10 array in my Poweredge T420, and i would like to future proof my backup drives in the case of a drive failure, but i wasn't sure if my replacement drives need to be in a certain format for the swap to take place. I noticed there was a way to format drives as hot spares, is this what a replacement drive would need to be formatted as before it was popped in for the PERC to fail over a bad disks data from the backup, or can it be just as the drive is and the PERC will take care of everything? Thanks



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello the.mknabster,
 
You don't have to format the drive before installing.
You can do this while in the controller BIOS:
Insert the drive, set it as Hot Spare.
If it detects data on the drive it will show as Foreign. Clear the foreign then set it as Hot Spare.

"Hi all,I swapped storage controllers from H730p to HBA330 in a T630 after which the fan speed ramped to 55% PWM max (around 3k RPM). Server has been running for around a year with H730p and same HDD combination with no issues and near silent performance. No other hardware has changed.All firmware is up to date-BIOS is 2.13.0, iDRAC 2.82.82.82, HBA330 16.17.01.00Drives are 8 x Dell P/N W0VNC (TH0W0VNCSGT008BC00C8A00) with latest EA04 firmwareThermal profile is `Minimum Power`. Changing to `Default` doesn't change fan speed. Fan Speed Offset is `Off`. Minimum Fan Speed is `Default`. Removing all hard drives causes fan speed to return to normal.System has no active alerts. I've switched back to the previously working H730p but high fan speed remains. I've also unplugged all power + held power button for 20 seconds before powering on and gone through retire + repurpose wizard to clear all iDRAC and BIOS settings but issue remains.Any advice would be appreciated!



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","As expected, this is a long standing issue with Dell firmware. From their own documentation for previous generation servers-A system configured as non-RAID has a higher noise level than a system configured as RAID. With non-RAID, the temperature of the hard disk drives is not monitored, which causes the fan speed to be higher to ensure sufficient cooling resulting in higher noise levelA bit of Googling shows the problem has only gotten worse with the next generation of tower servers having low quality, noisy fans and still don't allow a negative fan offset in situations like this.

"I'm having a number of issues in replacing a failed drive in my server.My configuration is a little ""oddball"", in that I have two RAID controllers in the box - an H310 connected to two SATA drives in the 5.25"" ODD bays (RAID1/OS), and an H710P connected to the backplane, running a RAID6 array (Data). Recently, one of the disks in the RAID1 array was marked as ""failed"", and the array marked as ""degraded"". I removed the failed disk, and replaced with a near-identical unit (same size, type etc.)That replacement disk is now marked as ""foreign"", and I'm unable to find any way to add it to the array. Whether I use the H310 BIOS configuration utility or OMSA, it is always marked as ""foreign"", and I'm unable to utilise it in the array.I am unable to add it as a hot spare, or indeed do anything else with it. I'm beginning to think that I'll need to pull the original (still good) disk, and replace it with one identical to the ""new"" replacement I installed and completely reinstall the OS (which I'm obviously keen not to do). Is there any way I can ""force"" the controller to add the new disk to that RAID1 array, and thus have the array rebuilt?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hmmm...I may have stumbled on the answer. It appears that the ""new"" disk was being viewed as though it had a foreign (RAID) configuration on it. I was able to ""clear"" that foreign configuration, and the disk appeared as ""ready"". I then added it as a hot spare, and a few moments later, it's status changed to ""rebuilding"".

"My R720xd is running all of the system board fans at full speed continuously.
On powerup, the fans bump to high speed for a second, then settle down to reasonable speed, and stay at reasonable speed during POST, right up to the point where iDRAC initializes, at which point they all kick up to full speed, and stay there. From that point on, the fans go full speed. Nothing short of a reboot or shutdown will stop them.
I'm not exaggerating even slightly. The fans run at 17,000 RPM, 24 hours a day. It's so loud it can be heard through the walls on the other side of the building.
There is no OS installed on this machine.
I've upgraded to the latest firmware, tried changing the performance profile in the bios, and tried the whole hold down the power button while unplugged thing as well.
There's no possibility that it's overheating. Inlet air temp is 22 degrees, exhaust is 27, CPU temps are 35-40 degrees.
I've found other references to people having similar problems with R720s, but there doesn't seem to be any single common cause for it.
Any suggestions?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Just wanted to follow up on the resolution to this issue. The firmware and hardware configuration were fine, the problem ended up being a defective motherboard.
Dell sent a tech to replace the motherboard, and once that was done, the fans were running normally. The tech said that he's seen this several times, and replacing the motherboard is the fix.
Hopefully this will help someone else.

"HiTwo dell servers; Windows Server 2016 Standard DC (PE T440) and Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard member server.We have a peculiar networking issue. We started getting network connection issues. This happens for a few seconds and at no particular interval but let’s say once every one to two hours.Here is what we noticed;On member server the RWW connection will break for a few seconds and then restored.However we also get MS Access database crashes which complains that network connection was lost and to restart db to continue. The MS Access database was running from a shared folder on the DC. We moved the db to a shared folder on the member server but MS Access database still crashed.We moved both DC and member servers to a different switch. No luck. We reinstalled Windows Server 2016 standard on DC and moved back MS Access database to a shared folder on DC but still no luck and MS Access database still crashes.Could all this be due to DC hardware networking issues such as faulty network card or network cabling connecting DC to switch? At this point I am considering changing both DC’s network card and cable.Is there something someone can suggest to home in on this issue?ThanksRegards

					Go to Solution.","Hi, that's really some peculiar issue I guess. The fact that the problem is happening from time to time and not in a certain pattern made me think that the problem was not caused by the server. Here I will suggest you to update NIC drivers and firmware. https://dell.to/3pQOyst If there is no error in the SEL log then I would think that it is more likely to be caused by DC networking.

"I have eight M910 blade servers installed inside of an M1000E enclosure. I installed them, one by one, while systematically installing an operating system on each one. Now, I want to network them all together. However, for some reason, I can get no more than five of them to run, at the same time.Once the M1000E has been powered on, I start pressing the ""on"" buttons on each of the servers. I get a solid blue light for each of them, until I push the power button on the sixth server. When I push the power button on the sixth server, the power button blinks a few times, and then stops. If I try to turn it on, via the web-based CMC browser, I receive a message which states ""Another action is being performed on this server. Try again"".I can wait, for several minutes, and try again. However, I continue to get the same result. The power light blinks a few times, and then stops. However, if I turn off one of the running servers, and then try to turn on server six, server six starts up, with no problem. Then, when I try to turn on the other server, that I just turned off, it's power button blinks a few times, and won't turn on.This strange phenomenon seems to happen to any of the servers. It doesn't seem to matter which ones get turned off, or turned on. However, I can only get five of them to turn on, with no problem. Whenever I try to turn on a sixth, the power button just blinks a few times, and then stops. If I try to turn on a seventh one, the power button just blinks a few times, and then stops.Based on this behavior, I began to think that, perhaps, all of this is due to insufficient power from the power supplies. I'm using three 110v power supplies. However, each one is supposed to be capable of putting out 1350 watts. With five servers running, the M1000E shows that the entire system is only consuming about 1600 watts. So shouldn't the three power supplies be capable of providing enough power to power all eight blades?Each blade has 128 GB of RAM and four E7-4830 processors.I'll probably end up buying more 110v power supplies, and try running the M1000E with a total of six, instead of three. However, because each power supply can put out 1350 watts, and I have three of them, shouldn't that provide roughly 4050 watts of capability? If so, then why am I not able to turn on another server when power consumption is at 1600 watts?I should also note that, while looking at power configuration options, in the web-based CMC tool, I checked ""Server Performance Over Power Redundancy"". Shouldn't that ensure that these three power supplies are being used to their maximum potential?I look forward to hearing any suggestions that anyone may be willing to provide. I really need to be able to run all eight blades.  Thanks for your time.

					Go to Solution.","Well, as suspected, it turns out that adding additional power supplies, solved this issue.  I was able to install two more 110 volt power supplies.  After doing that, I've been able to boot up six of the servers, simultaneously, without issue.I haven't been able to test whether or not all eight servers will boot.  This is because my remaining two servers have other issues, and require more parts.  However, I have reason to believe that, once I get those parts, they, too, will boot.

"Hi,We have two old PowerEdge R620 servers  where the support has expired, both have Enterprise license idrac 7, but on one of them, the license suddenly disappeared after a power recycle, and is now of type ""Express"". Unfortunately I don't have any information in my digital locker for these servers, so I'm unable to recover the license from there.I have setup a recurring backup of the server profile to vflash on both. But on the host that has lost the license, it is not possible to select vflash to import back the profile, because the license probably doesn't anymore include the vflash operations..?Is the license actually backed up to vflash, and is it possible to recover the license from it somehow?Kind regards, Håkon  



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hakoni,
 
The issue is likely due to it losing rights to the functions needed when it reverted to Express. So what I would suggest is that you try loading the trial version of the iDrac 7 license, then after you do that then Import your license via the vflash.
 
You can find the trial version here.  
 
Let me know if this helps, or if you have any other questions.

"Apparently trivial question... but I'm failing to find an even vague answer.

We have an R630 and we are considering adding a video card to run computations on GPU. The manual states that slot 2 is a ""PCIe x16 connector with x16 bandwidth; 3/4 length , full-height"". So a half-height graphic card should fit there without problem. But then the manual makes no reference whatsoever to graphic cards, and www.dell.com/.../poweredge-gpu doesn't mention the R630 at all. Are we missing anything?

Unfortunately the R630 doesn't look to support the use of internal GPUs. The slot specifications you listed are correct, but it is likely due to a lack of a power connection for the GPU to use, that makes it unsupported.

Dell EMC drives are not a requirement for our PERCs, but non-Dell EMC drives are not supported. If the drives are working without issue then I suggest making note of the firmware they are currently using. If you change the firmware on the drives or controller it may cause issues.

I would start with trying the servers minimum to post configuration, which is removing everything internally and externally from the server but the following;
 
● System board● One power supply unit● One processor (CPU) in socket CPU1● One memory module (DIMM) installed in socket A1● Left control panel (for power button functionality)● One backplane card
 
After removing everything but the devices listed above then try powering up, if it still doesn't power then try swapping the power supply with the other. If it still doesn't post after that then try both power supplies, individually, in the power supply 2 slot. This will see if it may be an issue with a slot.
 
If it still doesn't work then I would go through the minimum to post list and verify all of the devices are seated firmly, you can also try reseating each (if possible).

So when enabling PXE boot once using redfish, is there some way to force it to use ""NIC.Integrated.1-2-1"" or some other specified NIC?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Managed to sort this out.In 13th generation Dell PowerEdge servers the boot order of NICs is taken into account when PXE boot once is enabled with IPMI or redfish. It does not matter which NICs have PXE enabled.This is contrary to older Dell servers where the same kind of boot uses the NICs that have PXE enabled. NICs with PXE enabled are favored over NICs with PXE disabled, regardless of the boot sequence.It is also contrary to the PXE boot once that was initiated with F12 key press.So this was fixed by setting the NIC I wanted to be the first NIC in the boot sequence, and it does not matter which NICs have PXE enabled.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello finaria,
 
Thank you for choosing Dell.
 
General memory module installation in case of R730XD is follow:
 

RDIMMs and LRDIMMs must not be mixed.
x4 and x8 DRAM based memory modules can be mixed. For more information, see the Mode-specific guidelines section.
Up to three dual- or single-rank RDIMMs can be populated per channel.
Up to three LRDIMMs can be populated per channel regardless of rank count.
If memory modules with different speeds are installed, they will operate at the speed of the slowest installed memory module(s) or slower depending on system DIMM configuration.
Populate memory module sockets only if a processor is installed. For single-processor systems, sockets A1 to A12 are available. For dual-processor systems, sockets A1 to A12 and sockets B1 to B12 are available.
Populate all the sockets with white release tabs first, followed by the black release tabs, and then the green release tabs.
When mixing memory modules with different capacities, populate the sockets with memory modules with highest capacity first. For example, if you want to mix 4 GB and 8 GB memory modules, populate 8 GB memory modules in the sockets with white release tabs and 4 GB memory modules in the sockets with black release tabs.
In a dual-processor configuration, the memory configuration for each processor should be identical. For example, if you populate socket A1 for processor 1, then populate socket B1 for processor 2, and so on.
Memory modules of different capacities can be mixed provided other memory population rules are followed (for example, 4 GB and 8 GB memory modules can be mixed).
Mixing of more than two memory module capacities in a system is not supported.
Populate four memory modules per processor (one DIMM per channel) at a time to maximize performance.

 
Source: https://dell.to/3bAglGW
 
 
For PowerEdge R930 general memory module installation guidelines are follow:
 

Populate DIMM sockets only if a processor is installed. For dual-processor systems, sockets A1 to A12, B1 to B12 and sockets C1 to C12, D1 to D12 are available. Each processor requires a minimum of 2 DIMMs, which must be identical.
Populate all sockets with white release lever first, then black, and then green.
Populate the sockets by highest rank count in the following order — first in sockets with white release levers, then black, and then green. For example, if you want to mix single-rank and dual-rank RDIMMs, populate single-rank RDIMMs in the sockets with white release tabs and dual-rank RDIMMs in the sockets with black release tabs.
The memory configuration for each processor should be identical. For example, if you populate socket A1 and B1 for processor 1, then populate socket C1 and D1 for processor 2, and so on.
Memory modules of different sizes can be mixed provided that other memory population rules are followed (for example 8 GB and 16 GB memory modules can be mixed).
Populate four DIMMs per processor (one DIMM per channel) at a time to maximize performance.
If memory modules with different speeds are installed, they will operate at the speed of the slowest installed memory module(s) or slower depending on system DIMM configuration.

 In case you have failed DIMM_A4, you need to replace it. It is important also to isolate memory issue before replacing. Not always errors on DIMMs indicates that DIMM needs to be replaced. Full troubleshooting steps you can find in this article:

I am not certain as to why they would need a svc tag at all. Now in the past we had servers with mid life motherboard changes that would affect dimms supported, but not with the R910. The only basis i can see them asking for is to define how many memory risers are installed to know how many dimms you can upgrade. 
 
As far as the svc tag goes, it wouldn't change the supported dimms for the server even if you give another R910 svc tag. 
 
Let me know if this helps.

I have a 2950 with 1x E5310 CPU (quad-core 1.6GHz 1066FSB) / 32GB RAM / SAS RAID etc for a virtual test bed at home, to which I want to add a second CPU.
I thought about buying another E5310, there are often some on eBay. However I also have access to a pair of E5345s (quad-core 2.33 GHz 1333FSB), which are also clovertown family, from a server here at work with a dead mobo.

					Go to Solution.","There were three models of the 2950.
Only the 2950 MARK (III) could accomodate a quad core processor.  As long as the unit has the (III) designation in the top left corner, those processors will work within the unit.  If the marking is a (I) or (II), it woulnt work.  Below is a list of the supported processors for a 2950 (III) only. 
Xeon X5365Xeon X5355Xeon E5345Xeon E5335Xeon E5320Xeon E5310Xeon L5335Xeon L5320  Xeon L5310
 


Actually, per the Information update (available from Dell's 2950 documentation), <ADMIN NOTE: Broken link has been removed from this post by Dell> ""If the front of your system chassis is labeled with a “II”, your system is upgradeable to the 5100 series of dual-core Intel Xeon processors and the 5300 series of quad-core Xeon processors."".
And then it says ""If the front of your system chassis is labeled with a “III”, your system is upgradeable to the 5100 and 5200 series of dual-core Intel Xeon processors and 5300 and 5400 series of quad-core Intel Xeon processors."".
So, the II can already accommodate quad core processors, but only the 5300-series (the 5100 is the dual cores). The III can also accommodate the 5400-series quad cores (the 5200 is the dual cores for that generation).

But strange thing is that Out of 16 drive each one of them shows 'Ready' status as I plug them. But as soon as I configure them to build raid0 each of one them converts into 'failed'. So we are thinking that these disk are actually failed. But as I was googling these much disk failure, I got one of thread here, which said it is not really possible to failed even 2disk together, there might be some firmware or BIOS related issue. Hence I updated iDRAC and BIOS of the system. It's working fine but I also wanted to update SAS RAID firmware, but as soon as I start the upgrade I get this message 'This update package is not compatible with your system configuration'.

Attempting to reset the IDRAC module by holding down the info button has proven unsuccessful as well.

Can you provide some history on this server;  Was it working and now it does not? If so what was done around the time this started?
 
You can find the default iDRAC password on the pullout luggage tag on front of the server.
 
You may be correct thinking motherboard.  Let me put these troubleshooting steps, most you have done already, to see if you completed them thoroughly and if you have just check it off and move to next one:
 
drain flea power (shut down, disconnect power cables and Network cables, hold in power button 20 seconds with cords removed).  After flea power drain, system has to set for 3 minutes for DRAC to reset without any power plugged in, then plug in NIC and power but wait 2 minutes before power on to give DRAC time to initialize.
 
Check results
 
Clear NVRAM - there is a map under the lid to show the jumper location. Shut down,  Set jumper to the Clear position, power on and Post up to the jumper error, shut down and return to original location.
 
Check results
 
Minimum to post testing
The minimum components to allow the Dell™ PowerEdge™ T430 to complete POST are:
 

System board
One power supply unit (and for redundant PSU also the PIB)
CPU1 with heat sink (minimum for troubleshooting)
Single DIMM configuration with DIMM in socket A1
Control panel with cable (to power system on)

 
 
Remove anything not on the list: DVD, Hard drives, PERC controller, backplane, NDC, network card, any pcie cards…
 
While in there check for any bent pins on DIMM slots, CPU sockets, any other connectors
 
If it does not post then the issue is with one of those components.
 
If you get successful POST, put things back a little at a time until you find the faulting component.
 
Then update BIOS when you are able to post successfully.

PERC battery replacement is, fortunately, pretty easy. It is something that requires a maintenance window, however. What you'll need to do is shut the server off, remove the top cover, and then identify your PERC controller. It will have SAS cables connecting it to the backplane. You should also see another smaller cable and header. This smaller cable and header will be for the battery. You'll just want to unplug the cable and remove the battery, then replace it. You can then return to normal use. You might also check OMSA to see if it shows a learn cycle for the battery.

Yes, it is available. There are several requirements for the GPU configuration. If you do not select options that fulfill those requirements then the option to add a GPU will not be present. You can review the system manual for GPU requirements.

For the R740,

Select dual 1100w or higher power supplies. It is fine for them to be listed as redundant in the purchase.
Select a 2CPU configuration, this is in the chassis section
Select a valid PCIe riser configuration, the GPUs available may be limited based on the riser selected

If you select those three options then GPUs should be available as an option. You may need to select other options, like performance fans, to be able to finalize the purchase.

Both the 14G and 15G servers are awesome. Coming from a support viewpoint, I *VERY MUCH* like the 14G servers and the 15G are looking to be great, too. 
 
The xd is short for ""Extra dense,"" I'm pretty sure. That said, the other suffixes aren't anything I've ever explored or tried to find what they may stand for. For example, the R730XD has more storage capacity than the R730, due to a mechanical difference in chassis design.
 
Both the R640 and the R650 are using DDR4 memory, but the R650 is exclusively showing memory speeds of 3200MHz in my parts database. One difference is that the hardware sets that the generations get validated with get refreshed, but as you'll see in the forum, many officially unsupported pieces of hardware still work out fine.
 
Hopefully this sheds some light, but I feel like a phone conversation may be more productive. There are similarities in hardware support, and depending on what your needs are, the 14G may be perfectly suited for them. I would be more than willing to bet that either would be satisfactory, though,

I downloaded the oldest version of the BIOS available from DELL (BIOS_832M2_WN64_2.3.2_02.EXE) REF: https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/poweredge-t330/drivers It uploads fine and I select ""Install and Reboot"", which as expected kicks it to the job queue.  The job queue, shows it downloading, then it reboots, and shows the following: This is where I'm stuck, it never transitions out of ""Scheduled"". I've tried a warm boot, cold boot, graceful shutdown, nothing seems to help.On the VGA display output (as I don't have idrac enterprise), it just shows the existing error for ""Memory is detected, but is not configurable.""I've been at this on/off for two days, so any help is appreciated.

For example, when the 12G systems began sales, you could purchase an R510 or an R520 for only a few short weeks before the R510 disappeared. The R410 and R420 were sold simultaneously for quite a while before the R410 disappeared from Dell's site.

					Go to Solution.","I've never had too much of an issue jumping small numbers of versions at a time. The BIOS is already up to date in your post (6.6), so that much doesn't need to be worried about. For the iDRAC, I'd update to 1.99, then 2.80 (oldest 2.x version I'm seeing hosted) then to the current 2.92 version.
 
iDRAC6's web update interface is for the iDRAC firmware only, it may also work for the BIOS (it's been too long since I've needed to test or check, so take this with a grain of salt). That said, with the BIOS already being up to date, that's a bit of a moot point. Your other items, like any PCI NICs or a PERC, wouldn't be updatable through the web interface, though.
 
If you only have 1x of these systems, I'd go ahead do the updates this way. However, if you have a bunch of these systems, you can use Repository Manager to create your own firmware .iso. I've only done this once and remember there being a bit of a steep learning curve to it, but this was also quite some time ago.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hi @R320Cluster,
 
OEM PowerEdge usually cater to companies that they would like to have their own brand, customize firmware to their environment requirement and customized configuration. I'll basically go straight to you questions:

Is an OEM XL R720 compatible with standard Dell firmware/BIOS and associated software?

No, they are not compatible with standard firmware and BIOS. Software like OMSA, OME and other applications are subject to their compatibility. Will need to check on each of the application user guide for it. 


Is the hardware potentially modified or substituted by Dell for a specific customer's needs?

Yes, they are customized for each customer's needs. Though, we're unsure what specific customer requirements, only the customer and the Dell software engineer works together to obtain newer releases. 


Is there a reason why a standard R720 would be preferable over an OEM XL system?

Generally, that will depend on individuals. Standard servers will have standard support. OEM XL will need specific support. Support in a sense of firmware updates and hardware compatibility.



Here's a simple article back in 2011 on OEM branding: https://dell.to/3BYL77F

Bind the license with the service tag you are going to use it on. After it is bound you can download the license file.

The system hasn’t been updated in several years.

					Go to Solution.","I got it working. It turns out the LSI adapter can have varying levels of being disabled. And there appears to be a bug. I had it entirely disabled, yet it let some OSes could still see the disks behind it. Windows in UEFI mode could install to them, but the system can’t boot from them at all. Windows in BIOS mode could not install to them, correctly noting the adapter was BIOS-disabled. Once I enabled it, I can now boot from Linux. By the way to enable the card, one must boot from something; otherwise, the adapter control utility won’t load.Thanks to all who answered.

					Go to Solution.","Hi,
 
What Shine K has mentioned, is correct. There is no validated GPU for T140. We had the same post thread before about T140 GPU support, here: https://dell.to/3ihoTqv , probably the public user's experience may help you get the information that you needed. I would like to emphasize that there is no validated GPU by Dell engineering.

"I have a PowerEdge R520 that we are trying to upgrade from using 4 hard drive bays to 6. The BIOS only recognizes the first 4.They are all SATA drives, and there is 1 cable from the motherboard labeled SATA A-D going to SAS-A in the backplane. There is an Empty SAS-B on the backplane.

"Hi,According to iDrac, the PowerEdge T440 I have is all well and fine. All components show a green tick.However, when querying with SNMP, the 'cooling' component reports status ""1"" (other).Background: We monitor all our servers and infrastructure using PRTG, which in this example uses SNMP directly to iDrac. The PRTG sensor is setup, but reporting result ""1"". The possible values for OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.674.10892.5.4.200.10.1.44.1 areother(1), unknown(2), ok(3), nonCritical(4), critical(5), nonRecoverable(6)We have other Dell PowerEdge servers deployed (albeit none are T440's), and the monitoring in PRTG of these servers matches what we see in iDrac, so I can't work out why this discrepancy.The T440 BIOS is up to date. There is a single fan in the chassis, which is reporting as operational and I can view the fan RPM, which fluctuates slightly when I refresh the page. I have also confirmed locally that the fan is spinning.PS: The server resides in Hong Kong (purchased in HK) but is supported from the UK. I spoke with a UK technician who said they can only go by what iDrac is reported, but did offer to replace the fan regardless of it working correctly.Has anyone else seen an issue like this? I could ignore the monitoring of the fan, but this seems a likely component to fail, so would prefer to keep monitoring it.Thanks in advance.



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello,
 
I can't really speak to SNMP, all the hardware monitoring I've done has been in the iDRAC interface. If the iDRAC is reporting everything as healthy, I'd be more inclined to think that there was some unexpected behavior taking place. Updating iDRAC firmware might be worthwhile. Flashing it would flash both the iDRAC and LIfecycle controller, and is a very big part of SNMP alerting.

The X5365 appears to be the most powerful of the Clovertown family: http://ark.intel.com/products/codename/23349/clovertown
Please note that not all processors within a family are compatible. There may be a few that we have not validated, so always check before purchasing a processor.

"I've got an FC630 without an NDC, running in an FX2s chassis with an FN 410T IOM.Question, can the FC630 network to the IOM without the NDC?I guess I don't really understand the purpose of the NDC unless it is needed to interface with the IOM.I figure the NDC must be important in some way as the 'health' of the server is listed as 'critical' without the NDC.Please educate me!

You would need the LOM bNDC  (LAN On Motherboard, blade Network Daughter Card) on the FC630 or you would not get a connection to the IOM.
 
This resource material should give you a good guide for the chassis networking.

I could run BIOS update from OS, CD/DVD(ISO) or floppy; but end up getting this error.

You might need to turn off the C-State in the BIOS for the server. After booting into the BIOS, go to System Profile Settings > Set it to custom and disable to C-state.

"Hello Everyone,I have, in my homelab, a Poweredge R320 for more than a year now and it always worked well. Two days ago, the server rebooted suddenly with an PWR2402 error. After this reboot, the error disappeared, but the iDRAC interface was not available, neither by the webinterface nor by ping. (iDRAC 7 Express).After several tests, the iDRAC seems to be working when the server is powered off or when it starts for the first time after plugging power cords, but as soon as ESXi boots, the iDRAC interface is not responding anymore.I already tried to: - Change iDRAC IP and even put in a VLAN with only my PC and the iDRAC interface (to avoid a possible IP conflict). Same problem - Dedicate a NIC for iDRAC and another one for ESXi Mgt Network (all my VM already had a dedicated NIC). Same problem - Soft resetting iDRAC from ""Racadm"" utility in VMWare. - Update iDRAC and Lifecycle Controller to latest version available for my server (2.65.65). Same problem - Power off the server and unplug power cords for 1 min, while pressing the power button. iDRAC works until ESXi boots up - Boot a Windows PE on a USB stick. iDRAC works even after Windows booting.My last changes on this server was last month, but I don't think that's the cause: - Changing CPU to a E5-2470V2 - Updating ESXi 6.7 to 6.7U3, enabling SNMP on the iDRAC interface to monitor it.Do you think that a full iDRAC reset (and wiping my config) will be a solution? Have you ever heard about this problem? Do you have any ideas or recommandations?Thank you in advance for all your answers.Have a nice day.

Do you have a DRAC Dedicated port you can try?
 
It looks like this could be due to an unsupported operating system. You indicate it does not occur when booting to Windows.  Dell has only validated up to ESXi 6.5 for the R320. I do understand you say you have had ESXi 6.7 working, however this is an unsupported OS and do not know what the behavior would be on this OS.
Supported OS : https://dell.to/3d3lOaa
VMware ESXi 6.5
 
If you roll back the U3 update does it run like it did before the update?
 
If you don't have one, you may look at getting a dedicated port card. If this OS has a lock on the NIC ports then giving the DRAC a dedicated port may help.

Under the current memory configuration and populating the 2x 16GB memory modules to the remaining 2 slots may trigger memory errors during POST, prompting you to press F1/F2 key to continue; because the memory configuration is not optimal. Refer to the diagrammatic illustration below:

For optimal memory configuration, the memory modules on Channel 1, Channel 2 and Channel 3 have to be identical. Therefore, you will have the following configuration:
A1 &A2 = 16GB and A4 & A5 = 8GB. Alternatively, you buy one 16GB memory module to add to Channel 3 hence A1, A2 &A3 = 16GB and A4, A5 &A6 = 8GB with total memory capacity of 72GB.

The SUU you're referring to isn't a bootable file. The Lifecycle controller may be able to interact with the SUU, but I'm not certain this generation was capable of doing so. I don't believe that it could, but it's something worth double checking. Updating in-band won't be an option, because Debian isn't supported. If the LCC doesn't work with the SUU, then It think you would be best served by grabbing the Dell Support Live image, booting to that, and running individual firmware packages through there. The Support Live image is CentOS based and shouldn't get hung up on OS version scans.
 
There is also the Repository Manager tool, which can be used to create your own bootable firmware update image, but there would be a fair amount of effort involved. I've only created one myself once and I remember it being a bit tricky.,

ipmitool raw 0x30 0x30 0x01 0x00   (This allows you to override the system controlled fan speed)

"Greetings Folks..
I have two R610's, one of which sounds like an airplane and the other is as quiet as a normal desktop.
The quiet system runs (idle) at 24C, with fan speeds between 3000 and 4560 rpm.  
The loud system runs (idle) at 18C with most of the fans around 7080rpm.  
Both systems are using the latest versions of firmware and bios.
The quiet one has dual X5570 @ 2.93Ghz and the other has dual X5677 @ 3.47Ghz
My question is, would this difference in CPU make such a big difference when it comes to fan speed?






					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","My question is, would this difference in CPU make such a big difference when it comes to fan speed?
Yes, it can.
The BMC and BIOS work together to control fan speeds. The BMC is programmed to run fan speeds within a certain threshold based on system configuration. A minimal configuration will have a low fan speed minimum, and will increase up and down with system temperature. A maximum configuration will have a higher minimum fan speed.
I don't have access to the exact settings the BMC is programmed for, but different CPUs can change the minimum fan speed settings. You might want to try reflashing the BIOS and BMC/iDRAC, and also clear NVRAM to make sure there is nothing corrupted in memory. If you still encounter the same fan speeds then that is what the BMC/iDRAC is programmed for.
Thanks

The error is specifically referring to the fact that the logging of the dimm error is disabled. What I would do to isolate the issue is to clear the hardware log, then shut down the server and swap dimm A2 with another matching dimm in the server. If the error moves to the location you moved dimm 2 to then the issue is a bad dimm. If the error stays at the A2 slot after swapping the dimm then the issue is likely the board.
 
 
Let me know what you see.

"tired to search articles and documents but not sure about all the possible methods to update iDRAC firmware, especially after disaster.Currently I got poweredge R740 server with iDRAC9. The easiest way I know to update iDRAC9 firmware is via the WEB UI. So simple. What if disaster happens? Such as a brutal power cut during iDRAC update?The document (p.45)said that ""If the iDRAC firmware update is interrupted, you may have to wait up to 30 minutes before attempting another firmwareupdate.""But my question is, if the iDRAC web UI can no longer be accessed after the disaster described above, will the SSH + RACADM cli work to update iDRAC?Or maybe ""racadm racreset soft -f""/""racadm recreset hard -f"" is powerful enough to recover the iDRAC back to normal?BTW,is it doable to update/recover iDRAC firmware from BIOS? Thanks in advance.

"Okay so to clarify before anything. This server is NOT being used in a business environment. Its literally being used as a home Media Server (yes, way overkill I know but i got it for free so whos complaining).
Im currently using a PowerEdge 2950 as my home media server, I have just picked up its upgrade, a R710 Gen 2 and I would like to use all 6 bays at the front for hard drives that I can put media onto rather than 1 for the os and then all the rest for media.
How would I go about installing an internal hard drive, preferably an SSD, inside the R710. I know it has a spare SATA Data port but I cant seem to see any spare power cables or molex cables like there is in the 2950 Gen 3 that I have.
If it is not possible, thats totally fine but I would like to have installed an internal drive.
I know there is a USB port but I am using Windows Server 2012 R2 (Probably soon to be Server 2016) but i am unsure if Windows Server can be installed to the internal USB.
If you need specs, or the service tag i can give you that information!
Any Help would be appreciated.

"Hi, I have a PowerEdge R510 with eight 4GB DIMMs. I want to add memory in the most cost effective way possible, but don't understand what I can replace where and have a balanced config. Can anyone help me sort this out?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","I think replacing two 4 GBs with 8 GBs will help enough
It would be good to know how much total memory you are looking to have but 8x 8GB (total capacity of 64 GB) sounds economical.
I want to get the most bang for my buck. 16 GBs seem a lot more costs per GB, From some of the posts I have read, one channel or bank or something can be a different size or something.
16 GB memory modules do cost a little more but provide room for future memory upgrade. Yes, the R510 server has a rather unique memory population guidelines. For CPU A, it consists of 3 channels; CH0, CH1 and CH2. CH0 comprises slots A1 &A4 while channels CH1 and CH2 comprise slots A2 &A3 respectively. A similar pattern holds for CPU B. Refer to the diagram below:

In populating memory, the memory in each channel has to match and being populated in the strict order of A1 (for 1 DIMM), A2 ( when 2 DIMMs are used), A3 and lastly A4. Note that the memory DIMMs on CH0 do not necessarily have to be same, they can be of different capacity with larger size module populated on slot A1 and the other on slot  A4.

"Hi all,I have R230 and currently my OS (ESXi) is installed on 3.5'' HDD, which occupies one hot swap slot. My plan is to move OS to either sd, ssd or 2.5'' hdd (instead of optical drive), so I could use all 4 hot swap slots for raid configuration (currently have 2 HDD in raid with perc H730).There is an info about IDSDM in R230 manual but I cannot find module that says that is compatible with R230. So my first question is can I use IDSDM with R230 for OS and if so which one?If IDSDM isn't an option or if you think that ssd is a better option, my second approach to this would be to install ssd with ssd to pcie adapter.Would this work on R230 ?And the last approach (that I can think of) is to install 2.5'' hdd instead of optical drive. Found one tutorial that this can be done on R330 (https://www.tachytelic.net/2019/10/install-ssd-optical-13th-generation-poweredge/), but didn't found any information about R230.So my third question is, can I replace optical drive with hdd on R230 ?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","If you have really a H730 in our R230  than create a Diskgroup of all of your DISKs and when creating the VirtualDisk(VD) just enter 20GB instead of 100% of capacity.  After that you can create a additional VD with the rest of all capacity.This ends in a setup with 2 LUNs and when install your ESXi just pick up the small one and when ESXi is up and running you have to create a Datastore on the large LUN. So ESXi and your Data is protected by the RAID5 and you will get the speeds of all of your spindels.When ever you need to reinstall ESXi your VM Data is protected because the both LUNs are separated.If you try to install ESXi 7.0 increase the the size of the Boot LUN from 20GB up to 140 because ESXi installer would like to create 128GB OS_DATA Partition. Another way... you can install ESXi on a USB stick. Some poweredge servers have a internal USB slot otherwise you can plugin the stick from the outside. But iam not a Fan of USB.Regards,Joerg

"Hello all. I am a total noob about servers, though I have used client computers all my life. I am trying to learn servers and have home backup, so I got a r730 (I know it’s not entry level). I have (16) 600 GB SAS drives, 256 GB RAM.I installed ProxMox just fine the first time, but I saw I was using the Perc raid card. A little searching says I need to put it in HBA mode (I wanted to use zfs). I went into LCC and changed everything just fine, started ProxMox installation again from my USB, but when it finished and rebooted I was in RSoD, saying I had a UEFI Exception. I rebooted and it always goes to that screen now. I can’t use F2, F10, or F11. This is my sole node so I didn’t configure iDrac.

"I feel like I'm going to get a painfully obvious answer here, but how do I activate more ports for a blade server in a VRTX chassis?
Both my blades have 2 of 4 ports active.  If i go into port config in the I/O module GUI, the other two ports show ""down"", but there are no options to bring them up.
This makes me think that each blade server would have a setting for how many of the internal NIC ports it uses, but I can't find such a setting anywhere in chassis management GUI.
What am I missing?

					Go to Solution.","Hello
I feel like I'm going to get a painfully obvious answer here, but how do I activate more ports for a blade server in a VRTX chassis?
You can't enable more of the ports. You only have two available ports per node because of the switch/IOM you are using. The I/O module will only use the first two ports on each node. You will need to change to something other than the IOM to allow access to more ports. I think the IOM is the only available option that has this port restriction, but I have not checked every available option to be sure.

I have gone through everything I possibly can to update it and have failed at everything.

What you can try doing is downloading the 2008r2 version of the BIOS update, whish shares the same kernel as Windows 10, and see if it will allow it to run. Also, you can try to find another form of bootable media and run the bios update from a command prompt. Another suggestion is downloading OMSA Live ISO, and then running the RHEL 7 version of the BIOS update from the media when you boot to it.

Bottom line, get either 2-post rail or versa rail for the servers for your 2-post rack.
Let us know how it goes.

"Hi all, I recently was able to acquire a Poweredge T420 that i'm going to setup a RAID array (something i have never done) and combine my 3 home servers into one unit. On all my current servers, (Dell Precisions), i have an auto boot and auto shutdown time set, mainly because i don't want to the machine running when it's not going to be accessed, which is mainly overnight. So those 7-10 hours it is off, and then turns on in the morning.I would like to do the same with the Poweredge, but i don't see BIOS settings like how the Precisions have that can accommodate this. The machine does have an iDRAC card and lifecycle controller in it, have never used them before, but would that be what i need to use to do this with? Any help would be appreciated, this is a learning experience for me too, as i'm setting up a network switch with POE down there too, going all out with the upgrades. 



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello,
 
The iDRAC can help accomplish what you're looking for. The iDRAC web interface allows you to power up and power down a system at will, but I don't believe there is a scheduling option. You may be able to accomplish this with scripting, but it isn't something offered in our servers. I was unaware the Precision workstations offered this, but I don't believe you'll find a perfect analog in the iDRAC. The scheduling options I see extend to items like firmware updates or diagnostics, but not quite what you're looking for.
 
Both the iDRAC Express and the iDRAC Enterprise should allow you to remotely power up and power down the host.

Have you tried updating the iDRAC/LCC and BIOS to the latest and check if resolves the issue? Since slot A1 having issue, try this. Remove both power cables, press and hold the power button. Then remove all components accept the below and try to do the diagnostics, if you have the same issue, you may need to replace the main board.
 
•Risers•CPU1 (swap CPU2 with CPU1)•Heatsink for CPU1 for prevention of overheating•1 DIMM for CPU1 (swap any available DIMM with A1)•Power supply•Control panel•Motherboard•Power distribution board

"I have a PowerEdge R730xd. It came with Sandisk LT0200MO drives, 12 to be exact. There was a bug where they fail after 40,000 hours. I did not know about this, Dell was supposed to inform people who had the drives from what i heard but i never heard about it. This is our Database server, 2 drives in our RAID 10 database virtual disk died last night. I upgraded the firmware on all the other drives however, i could not upgrade the two working drives in that virtual disk due to the degraded array. So my question is, can i pull a drive from the other two functional RAID 10 virtual disks and then replace the failed drives in the Database virtual disk, so it can rebuild the array and i can upgrade those two good drives. I can't get replacement drives until Monday or Tuesday so i'm sitting on a ticking time bomb and am looking for the best possible option to save those last two drives in that virtual disk. 



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","So I don't really know how to explain what happened. I put new drives in, had all those issues. I decided i'm going to update the SAS RAID drivers and Firmware, then the BIOS. After that i went in to fix the degraded RAID, when i got it, there was no issues, it said the drives were already part of the RAID, so that was freakin weird. I got out since there didn't seem to be anything left to do in there. I tried to get into OMSA, that seemed broken now, so then to make sure the RAID wasn't degraded anymore for real, I ran the firmware update on the two drives in the RAID array i couldn't upgrade because it was degraded and it worked fine. So problem fixed, not sure how, but it was a best case scenario.

I see you want to use a more powerful GPU. You may be trial and error as Dell has only validated nVidia Q4000 or Q6000 for the T320.
 
The power distribution board is where you would connect the GPU power. See attached picture.

ASSY 2X4 GPGPU power cable, (From PIB Interposer to GPGPU Card)
 
You should also get PCIe Card Holder. A PCIe card holder is required to provide additional support when a GPU card is installed.

The PowerEdge T320 supports one internal double-width full-length GPU card, which is either nVidia Q4000 or Q6000.
GPUs are installed on PCIe x16 Gen3 Slot 3.

I would suggest toggling the voltage switch on the PSU to make sure it didn't move out of the 115v selection. Also, reseat the cabling and try another power cord. If the issue persists then I would look at swapping components.
This is the part number for the PSU: NH493
Some of our PSUs have extra connectors that make them proprietary. I'm not sure if this one is proprietary. I would suggest reviewing the specs and connectors to make sure they match any other PSUs you attempt.
Thanks

"HelloI appreciate this is a question about older equipment but hopefully someone will be able to help.  Does anyone know if any of the quad port 1Gb ethernet modules work in the M620.  I would like to use the R1-2401 switch and make use if all 16 available internal ports.  Currently all of my blades have the broadcom dual 10Gb modules installed.I know I cuuld use PCIe cards, but I am trying to keep the fan speed down and adding cards will not help with that.I know none of the quad port cards are listed as supported, but I wondered if anyone had tried it and found them to work OK?  I know there is quad port 1Gb for both the M520 and the M630, so I just find it odd there is not one for the M620.Cheers

I tried to search entirely on M620 VRTX for 1GB NDC but none listed. All of them are 10Gb. But I tried searching on M620 M1000e and found 543-BBCU. I am unsure if it would work, but it's worth a try if you're willing to. There is a write up from InfoWorld about VRTX and M620 with R1-2401. I would assume they are using the SKU part I gave you, as it's the only thing listed for M620 M1000e on 1Gb module. 
 
Let me know if you did try and does it work.

"I faced an weird situation. We have a R740 server with idrac9 (v4.32.10.00) and OMSA 9.5.0 has been installed. The OS version is RHEL 7.7I tried to configure email notifications using execute application with local SMTP server and without idrac9 configuration (to save one switch port).I can successfully connected to https://localhost:1311.  After configuration, I can tested sending an email to myself on the web server and it worked, I can also received a notification while running my shell script under OS level.But, when I unplugged one of the redundant power supply trying to simulate a scenario, the email notification didn't worked. I can found events report on the web server log and also in the /var/log/message, but there is no email events triggered and log in /var/log/maillog. I've been used this method on our other dell servers such as R430 with idrac8 and it worked well.I just can't figure out what's the difference. Does G14 server with idrac9 changes the strategy for email notification? Does idrac9 setup is necessary for OMSA email notification?  



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello @Roger04,
As you may know setting up alerts from OMSA is limited to the execute application option. On OMSA side, there are not many configurations possible. So most of the issues are normally related to the sending email application or script.
So, in fact, you don't need any iDRAC configuration to make OMSA execute the application as a reaction to the alerts. But 
Have you considered setting this email alerts notification from the iDRAC. In my opinion, the iDRAC would be a better option than OMSA. As the iDRAC email configuration have more options and is less dependant of other systems.

"Hi guys, Please recommend a high end graphics card for 2950. Which type ect. Thanks



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","After many arduous hours of searching forums and trying every trick or combination of things, this is what did not work for me.
* Nvidia NVS 290, PCIe-x1, boots perfect, Windows 7 sees it, but no video using the NVS 290.
* Removed the DRAC card as suggested, and restarted the server. I had a 6 minute boot time, got the extended monitor to work once, then epic fail on each restart. I concluded the NVS 290 definitely does not work.
* Tried an Nvidia NVS 280, PCIe-x16 as suggested in another post I read. I nodded the cars by removing pins 50-52. Installed the cars in PCIe-1. Started the computer, Windows loaded fine, but again no video on the NVS 280. I again removed the DRAC, but this time long boot hang with no video ever. Conclusion, the NVS 280 does not work.
What finally did work for me!
* I accidentally stumbled across an Nvidia NVS 285, PCIe-x16, HP model P283. Instead of modifying this card, I used a x8 to x16 ribbon cable, and installed the card in the PCIe-1 slot after removing the DRAC card.
* I booted the computer perfect. No hangs, no bangs, even scanning the raid drives and everything, I had a total boot time of under two minutes. 
I don't know of this will work on any other system, model, or configuration, but this exact card, a P283 using a ribbon cable in slot 1 worked for me. I now have dual screens, an extended desktop, and a very happy client. 
This was my server I had used:
Dell Poweredge 2950 III
CPU: Dual Intel Xeon Quad Core 2.5GHz
RAM: 16GB
Bios: Newest version as of 10/23/2014
HDD: 4x500GB in RAID 10, 2x2TB in RAID 0
PCIe-Slot-1: Nvidia NVS 285, 128MB, P283, PCIe-x16 mounted upside down using a x8 to x16 adapter. 
PCIe-Slot-2: Sound Blaster Audigy FX 5.1. PCIe-x1
PCIe-Slot-3: Cmedia 5.1 Digital Sound Card PCIe-x1 
RAID: PERC6i
Removed DRAC card completely. No other changes or mods to the system.
I hope this helps someone. I built this for a client I had that needed a new radio station server and it ended up turning out awesome, once I found the right card to use.

"Greetings,How does one update the firmware on the NDC of a M620 (G12) for PEVRTX?I know there is an update as my working blades have NDC firmware 7.10 and the blade I need to update is at 7.6 for the NDC. Also, the firmware for this card on the dell Support site shows the current firmware being number 25.x (if memory serves..) so mine seems well behind.I have tried:1. The platform specific firmware-updating boot CD. I used the iDRAC console, mapped the iso file, and booted off it per the instructions. It ran for 35 minutes, tried and failed to update the firmware for a backplane, then failed and bailed.2. I tried the iDRAC HTTPS method using downloads.dell.com. It offered me a diags package update and a ""driver-for-OS' package but no firmware updates at all. Not even the one the CD tried to install for the backplane...so another fail.3. Tried the iDRAC ""item specific"" method but both .bin files I found on the support site (using the service tag and selecting ""Networking"" and ""VMware 6.5"" as my criteria, one gets offered .bin files as  opposed to .exe files when Windows is chosen as the OS filter) for this M620 returned the ""RAC0613 file invalid"". Note the two bin files I tried are the only two files offered as 'firmware' all else is docs and 'utilities' so I saw no other viable choices...but this failed.Before I waste time on the Lifecycle method...is there a method for updating these POS blades that actually works? Like, works the first time without having to jump through 17 hoops?I am aware of this and the multiple methods it claims. I just want to find one that reliably works. You can tell that dell struggles with this because there are so many methods...who needs all these methods if there was one that simply worked?Updating Firmware and Drivers on Dell EMC PowerEdge Servers | Dell USThanks to all who reply!FPBPC



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Update:I went through the iDRAC ""Update and Rollback"" using the HTTPS option (pointed it at downloads.dell.com) and that found a QLogic driver. It turns out that these Broadcom ""NetXtreme I and II"" 57xxx bNDC cards for PE-VRTX were QLogic branded and then Marvel branded since their release. So while the Support site said one thing, I needed another.I did try the HTTPs method earlier when my firmware was 7.6.x and it did not reveal any updates. It wasn't until I updated to 7.10.18 for the NICs that the HTTPS method revealed the further update to 15.15.8 for that card, which is the latest greatest. So this is solved as far as issues updating the firmware of the NIcs.I still have a 70% ping loss rate though. Since this VRTX/Switch ""assembly"" is carrying user loads successfully (clean switch ports, no errors or drops etc.), and the issue follows the server across slots, and the firmware and drivers are all as 'matching' as I know to make them, and I have re-seated the card itself...I guess the card is bad. Drat.Might have to go the PCI-e mezz route and use 'external' cards as it were.Thanks to all who assisted, especially Shine-K!Regards to all,BrianFPBPC

It's possible that the first three symptoms you listed are all part of the same issue. If you haven't I'd try reseating your risers, cables, and PCI devices. If one of these persist, there may be a more serious issue requiring hardware replacement. 
 
For DIMM A3, you most likely just need to replace the DIMM. Still, if you want to be sure, you can test it in another memory slot to see if the issue follows the DIMM.

"So we just bought a brand new Dell Poweredge T640. We bought it with the BOSS card, about 32 TBs, 64 GB RAM, Gold processor, the works. So anyway, I am having an issue getting out to the internet or doing anything with this machine. I cannot remote into it, and it will not go out to the internet. I plug into the iDrac and I am able to get to that just fine, but when I plug an ethernet into either of the NIC's, it will detect it but will tell me there is no internet access. I have set a static IP, and it still doesn't connect. Remote desktop is enabled. Everything you normally do with a server has been done. The weird part is that I went into the add roles feature to go ahead and put in the hyper-v role, and even though there is a static IP, it shows that it's IP is 169.254.X.X which means it is not actually picking up it's IP address. What the heck am I missing here? This is my first time working with a BOSS controller, so I am not sure if that is the issue, but I am doubting it. This machine simply will not change its IP address. Even with DHCP enabled, ipconfig still just shows 169.254.X.X. Again, it detects that it has something connected, but it just will not do anything. Yes, drivers are up to date and existent.

					Go to Solution.","Hello
The BOSS card should not affect the network controllers ability to obtain a DHCP address or link with a switch. The T640 has multiple network options, the LOM is 10Gb, and they may not be capable of negotiating a speed with your switch. I suggest reviewing the specifications of the network controller that you are using and your switch. This is likely a link negotiation or switch configuration issue.

"Hello!
Having used HP servers before when I needed a new server for a project I decided to try a Dell PowerEdge instead. So I went ahead and ordered a brand new PE T710 tower server in lightweight configuration (1x XEON E5506, 4GB RAM, 1x 250GB SATA hot-plug, PERC H200 controller, 1 PSU). The server arrived 6 weeks ago, but due to my workload I have only recently found enough time to test it and set it up.
The main problem is that this server has a really poorly designed cooling system which is deafening loud. I really have a low-end config, but even in idle the four Delta AFC0912DE fans (6000 rpm max, pushing a staggering 160 cfm and producing an insane 63db(A) noise level) run at 2040 and 2400 rpm in a room that is at 20 deg C, blowing a huge mass of cold air out of the back end and producing a nerve-wrecking noise. Had I bought a rack server (which is meant to sit in rack in a data center together with dozens of other servers) then I would not complain. However, I have bought a tower server which is meant to be placed in a standard office environment, something which is not possible with this thing. We have a few HP ProLiant tower servers (ML350 G5 and G6, ML370 G6), and even our much better spec'd ML370 G6 does not produce such an amount of noise even when under load.
Since designing electronic components (aerospace) is part of my job, I had a closer look. Obviously the BMC is meant to be checking the temperature levels and adjusting fan rpm in accordance with heat levels. It seems to be badly done, though, as the exiting air temperature is the same as the intake air, which means there is very little heat transfer. A proper cooling design would keep the airflow just high enough to allow sufficient heat transfer from the components, which for this server with such a low end config would be at less than half the airflow (with the fans rotating at less than 1000rpm). Having the fans run at 2400rpm is not conservative, it is simply poor engineering, as the unnecessary high airflow not only creates noise but also increases fan wear and dust accumulation. This aside, I wonder why a two socket server like the T710 needs to have four 160 cfm fans @ 6000 rpm screaming at 63db(A) when a maxed out config (two fas 6-core XEONs, 144GB RAM, 8x 15k SAS HDDs) can be easily cooled with fans with much lower cfm rating like the AVC DS09238B12HPFAF (104 cfm @ 5000 rpm and 51 db(A)) or even the Delta T92E12BMA7-07 (83 cfm @ 4000 rpm and 43db(A)). And because for some reason Dell has decided to set the fan alarm threshold at 1080 rpm it's close to impossible to use other fans without triggering the low fan alarm. Overall I have to say I think this is a really poor design, especially for a device which is used in a noise conscious environment. 
And before someone asks: yes, latest BIOS is installed, as is the latest firmware for the BMC. Yes, I tried various fan performance settings in the BIOS without luck. And yes, I called Dell support, they looked into the problem but confirmed that the fan rpms are normal for this server. Unfortunately I'm over the 30 days return period, else I would have sent the thing back and bought HP instead. 
Does anyone know if there is a fix in form of a firmware/BIOS update in the works? Maybe not now that they're probably focussing on their new 12G servers due for Q1/2012. 
Any chance that someone from Dell reads this?

					Go to Solution.","Hi,

I was wondering if you actually found a solution to all that. We have a T710 here in our office and it is way too noisy, so it was locked up in the closet, which only results in a even hotter environment and even more noise... 

Anything I can do to make it actually quite enough to have it in the 20 degrees office environment again?

What does DELL say about this?

EDIT: I actually have a T320 standing next to me, which is even under high load not at all noisy! How can there be such a huge difference?

"Good evening folks.I have several racks of R640 1U servers. One of them is flashingscrolling an error on the front panel ""SWC5008: Critical"" but I'm having a hard time getting any other information on what the problem is. I found a page that says it is ""unable to access arg1 because ... "" but there is no argument given. Just SWC5008: Critical. The system is running Debian Linux (Version 10 -- Buster) and I can't seem to find any errors on the operating system level. I'm almost certain that no iDRAC setup was done when these servers were installed.Thanks for any information!Mike

This warning message is usually a cosmetic warning when momentary communication with the left front panel is lost. Mostly iDRAC updates fixed an issue wherein the Left Front Panel (LED, Quick Sync) intermittently stops communicating and logging errors SWC5008 and SWC5007. Please make sure the iDRAC and BIOS are up to date. For the latest iDRAC and BIOS version R640 https://dell.to/388RV5p
If you had an IDRAC connection, you would probably see a log like ""SWC5008: Unable to access Front LED Panel because of a hardware condition""
 
If you want to configure iDRAC, you can follow this article; https://dell.to/2LqILcGUpdate FW via iDRAC https://dell.to/2LqILJIOr you can update from within the LifeCycle Controller (LCC). https://dell.to/342eRBU
 
However, if the problem persists, a check as follows may be required.Check the Front LED Control Board cable for damage.Reseat the Front LED Control Board cable for connection issues.Replace the Front LED Control Board for LED failure.If this doesn't resolve, you can try replacing it with a known good if you have another R640.

"A few months ago, I purchased a PowerEdge T320 with an H310 RAID controller and hot-plug chassis. Like a few other people in this forum, I am disappointed with the performance of the H310, and I am considering to upgrade it to the H710p. The H310 is a full-height PCIe card with two connectors which are cabled up to the hot-plug hard-drive chassis. I would appreciate it if somebody could advise the part number for the H710p-equivalent, so I can simply disconnect the H310 and remove it, and then insert the H710p in its place with the same connectors etc and then import foreign config.

					Go to Solution.","Hi, a lot of questions you have here are actually best directed to sales.
 
 
2) Are the NVME drives connected to the PERC H745 or directly to the PCI bus?
H745 is a must for the NVME & SAS mix but depending on how you build your system “24 x NVMEs only with no PERC controller “ can be used too.
 
There are 3 kinds for H745 controller as you can see from here.
https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-my/perc-h755/perc11_ug/technical-specifications-of-perc-11-c...
But again this is best directed to sales.
 
3) If the disks, are not Dell certified will they be blocked by PERC H755, or just a warning?
It’s not blocked but the logs will say it’s non certified. It’s the same HDD model but Dell parts use their own firmware. Please be aware the support isn’t guaranteed for using non Dell parts.
 
 
Hope this helps and have a great one!

"Hi all,
Just trying to convince one of our R330 to boot from the SSD. I have BIOS Boot Mode enabled. However in System Bios -> Boot Sequence I have only HDD C:, and NIC Port 1 only options. System Bios -> Hard-Disk Drive Sequence is SATA E: (the SSD we want the boot to happen), then the rest of the disks. I tried to disable Hard drive C: from Boot Option Enable/Disable with no effect. Every time we bounce the machine it fails to find an OS. I have to select F11 and manually point to the SSD in order to boot it. Any hints about how to make the server boot by default from the SSD?

All options related to enabling/disabling or changing the boot order are in that menu. If the Hard-Disk Failover option is disabled then it will only attempt to boot from the first device in the HDD boot list.

"Hello Dell Community,I recently purchased a Dell R720 with the hopes of occupying the 8x HDD trays and booting off an NVMe drive within a PCIe adapter. After googling around, it seems this isn't possible, can anyone confirm this?The next option I tried was using this https://www.amazon.com/Tray-Universal-12-7mm-Enclosures-ThinkPad/dp/B075846MD2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&k... and replacing the DVD drive with a SATA SSD and unfortunately, that is not recognized at all as a device. Are there any other options with the R720 to add a boot drive (i.e SATA or NVMe) that isn't in the front of the chassis or am I stuck booting from a USB/SD Card?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Okay, it might be a bit late and Paul @paul_1011 was pointing it out in an article he shared - but to keep a bit more information in this thread rather than on an additional outside ressource:The point is, that 12th gen Servers lack the NVMe drivers necessary to recognise a NVMe drive at BIOS/UEFI level. The drivers necessary for this awareness were AFAIK added only to the UEFI bioses of later gen models (iirc >= 13th generation).There is an NVMe Flash option available to the R720 line up, but it will not add boot support, as this option is built around a PCIe 3.0 x16 adapter (D P/N YPNRC ) that splits those 16 lanes into 4x4 lanes with each lane than being occupied by one NVMe flash drive. The drives are thus only presented via PCIe to the OS, but not to the BIOS/UEFI, as Daniel @DELL-Daniel My states here Dell R720 with PCIe SSD-Backplane and Extender Card but no drives showing .So in short: there is NO direct way of booting NVMe drives on 12th gen DELL servers. However, you can do a simple trick to boot an OS stored on NVMe - and that's what Paul linked in his post:Boot to an (internal) USB/internal SD-card on which a boot loader like Clover resides. Add NVMe drivers to that boot loader to make the OS stored on your NVMe drive (e.g. a M.2 NVMe SSD connected via an adaptor in the back) visible to Clover. Clover will then boot from that NVMe drive.Kind regards and stay safeYannik

"Hey guys, this is my first time owning a dell server so please bear with me. I bought a secondhand Poweredge R230 server to set up a simple home lab and I'm already stuck. The server is currently running CentOS Linux 7 which I do not have the login for, but that shouldn't matter since I plan on reformatting it and installing Windows Server 2012 R2.Right now the issue is I'm unable to enter system setup, load the Lifecycle Controller nor even select boot device. This is the exact error message I'm getting: https://www.dell.com/support/article/en-us/sln305470/poweredge-start-up-message-unable-to-execute-cs... I've tried restarting it multiple times and still getting that message, disconnected all USB device except for the one keyboard I'm using to press F2/F10/F11. I'm unable to go into system setup to check if iDRAC is enabled, I've also downloaded the platform specific bootable ISO for the R230, written it onto a USB drive but even then I can't select a boot device from the server. Currently at my wits end and would appreciate any advice from the folks here, thanks!



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hi,
First of all please try to power drain as below;
The lifecycle controller error mostly could be tied to having the KVM USB cables connected. Remove all USB devices before to start power drain, please
 
1. Power the server down.
2. Disconnect server from all power cables, Network cables.
3. Hold down the power button continuously for at least 10 seconds.
4. Insert power cables and network cables back to the system.
5. Wait about 2 minutes before powering on server to give the iDRAC time to initialize.
6. Power the system on.
 
If still the same issue persists then you can try to soft reset iDRAC via ""i"" button 
Before that please check, Can you access to iDRAC? For PowerEdge servers using iDRAC7 and upwards, a small button that is marked ""i"" (Figures 1 & 2) is on the front panel of many tower and rack systems. In order to reboot the iDRAC, press the button for at least 30 seconds. Stop pressing the button when the cooling fans start spinning at full speed and the front LCD (if given) is turning off. Now the iDRAC restarts without changing any saved settings. It takes a few minutes until the remote controller works as before, but the system keeps working during the whole process.
Figure 1: I-button on PowerEdge R640 serverFigure 2: I-button on PowerEdge T620 server
 
 
If problem continue above steps, I would get min2POST configuration and check if there is any change in behavior. If you do , you can add one component at a time to help you identify the fault. If there is no change, the problem will most likely be caused by one of the components required for POST. 
The minimum components to allow the Dell™ PowerEdge™ R230 to complete POST are:

System board
CPU with heat sink (minimum for troubleshooting)
Single DIMM configuration with DIMM in socket A1
Control panel with cable (to power system on)
Power supply unit

If the server has the same error under min2post conditions. The motherboard may be faulty.

And the reason i modded my card was that the T610 does not have a x16 PCIe slot and i provided this info as background but it is also not directly relevant to your issue.

Anyway on page 28 & 29 of this document you will find the ""Integrated device"" BIOS screen for the T620, specifically page 29 shows ""Embedded Video Controller"" and a short description... What this document does not say is that you can not change the setting unless the system detects the card is actually inserted (well that's the case on the T610 and i expect it's the same on the T620).
So, if you insert a video card into your x16 slot and if you can't change the BIOS setting above, then either the card is faulty or the slot is faulty or you installed the card into a slot connected to the second processor socket in a single processor system which may not be a supported configuration.
Page 129 of T620 HOM states slot 5 through 7 can't be used unless two processors are installed. So if you installed the GPU in slot 5 and only have one CPU installed, this configuration won't work, try installing the GPU in slot 2.!!
If you can't access the BIOS setting for Embedded Video Controller, then this needs to be sorted out BEFORE you can proceed further, no point in trying to install drivers into the OS for a card the BIOS can't see!!! 
Oh, and if you do set the Embedded Video Controller to DISABLED but you still don't see any video output when you connect the monitor to the card, then you can always reset the BIOS back to default settings (which for Embedded Video Controller is ENABLED option) and reconnect your monitor back to the motherboard VGA connector. The system should work just as it did before (though you may have to go into BIOS and set those options you may have changed from their default values).
How to set BIOS back to default setting is not well described in the T620 HOW but look at the NVRAM_CLR jumper shown on page 125 & 126 and you should see that setting the jumper to pins 1-3 will reset the BIOS to default on the next boot. Presumably after the reboot you shut down the system and move the jumper back to pins 3-5 !! Just got to love the Dell documentation :emotion-1:
So go back to basics and tell us which slot you plugged your GeForce GTX card into and whether you can then access the Embedded Video Controller option within the Integrated Devices Screen in your T620 BIOS. And a list of the installed hardware may not go astray...

					Go to Solution.","Hello,
 
To begin, does the drive at least have a single solid green LED lit? It's not uncommon for someone to mistakenly mount the drive in the carrier incorrectly, which causes the drive to not seat with the backplane properly. You want to make sure that the drive is mounted such that the back of the drive is flush with the back end of the carrier.
 
Second, what is the drive itself? Does this happen to be a Dell branded drive? Non-Dell drives generally work, but not always. Some don't negotiate a connection. If it would be easier, you could share a picture of the drive label. That would provide relevant everything about the disk.
 
If none of that gives an answer, you can export the RAID controller log. It's a plain text file you can view in any text editor. You would just want to search the log to see what you can find about physical disk 0 or ""PD0.""

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hi 2ndSource.
 
The latest iDRAC firmware for R620 is 2.65.65.65. As it seems you have a very old firmware, so I recommend performing staged updates (like 1.66.65 -> 2.10.10.10 -> 2.30.30.30 -> 2.65.65.65).
 
Regarding the Lifecycle Controller, you first should update it to the latest version when it was separated from iDRAC.Here's the link: https://dell.to/2FClOjM
 
OR
 
You decide for the platform-specific bootable ISO: https://dell.to/3iAn4CL
 
with this ISO you update all components at once. For more guidance check out the related article Update PowerEdge Servers with Platform Specific Bootable ISO (SLN296511).

The problem is that we have 2 forests with full trust configured between them and iDRAC is not able to authenticate users from both of them.
Basically we have single domain security group on Forest1 and couple users from both forests (Forest1 and Forest2). If I add domain controllers' (DC) IPs for both domains-forests, authentication fails on the first DC if user is from different domain (check does not reach second DC's IP to check for the user).

"Anyone know if the PowerEdge T410 with the 1.12.0 BIOS is compatible with Xeon X5680's? The release notes indicate the system is compatible with 5600 series processors but I am unable to get the server to actually boot with them installed.

What I have tried:
Reset BIOS - NO-GO-
Reflashed BIOS to 1.12.0 - NO-GO-
Removed all other processors and RAM leaving only bank 1 - NO-GO-
Installed a single (didn't have another) ""known-good"" X5650 6-Core 130watt processor - ALL-GOOD-

Can someone assist and verify this for me? My Google-Fu is not returning any results...
Thanks in advance for your time...

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","The fact that the .pdf you linked to is buried several layers deep on the Dell website only solidifies my argument that it shouldn't take this much effort to find valid information such as that.

Furthermore, the 1.12.0 BIOS update simply states further support for more 5600 ""SERIES"" processors. The specsheet.pdf for the server states 5600 ""SERIES"" both of which are more easy to locate than the .pdf you linked to (i.e. Google Poweredge t410)

The technicalguide.pdf you linked to only solidifies my sentiment that Dell needs to be more clear about their documentation. Example 6.1 Overview (table 8) The Poweredge t410 provides support for up to two processors. It then lists 95 watt and 130 watt. Furthermore it gives reference to a set of supported processors but only goes up to the X5650. It gives no reference of what BIOS version was used during testing, however the date-stamp on the .pdf indicates July of 2011 but the newest BIOS version is from 2013. I hope with these examples you will be able to see that simply ""assuming"" things as ""good indicators"" can trip-up the most seasoned Sys Admins.

And FWIW the X5675's are the fastest highest watt TDP processors that can run in the T410. Thanks to me for figuring that out...

The Consistency Check and Offline process can be done in the controller BIOS or if you have OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) installed in the host.
 
To get into the controller during POST press <CTRL+R> when the controller initializes. Check legend at the bottom for navigation keys and press F2 when on selected item to bring up sub menu.

"Hello, I recently upgraded my two PowerEdge R720's to iDRAC 7 firmware version 2.65.65.65.  The upgrade process on both went smoothly, but now I am unable to access the virtual console for one of the servers.  When I try to load it I get a Login failed with access denied error message.  I am able to login to the web interface and I tried creating a new admin user but that didn't make a difference. Anyone have any ideas of things I can do to troubleshoot this error?Thanks,Raymond

This iDRAC update contains a fix for a security vulnerability. So this is probable the reason why you are getting this message.
 
So the problem appears when you try to use the Virtual Console on the iDRAC? But the access to the iDRAC works correctly? Right?
 
First thing I would like you to try is to ping -t the iDRAC IP and proceed to reset the iDRAC: How to reset the internal Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) on a PowerEdge server?
 
The ping -t will let you know when you can try to reconnect to the iDRAC.
Please, proceed to this operation and let me know the result.

By moving the server to your office, you have unplugged the power cable and the system has no power to it, that should lead the system to power flea which could help the situation. Usually we would request users do power flea on the system, to try revive the system up. 
 
Updating firmware could help the hardware do better data calculation and processing, it can help resolve the error. What you can do is, try doing a support assist log collection via iDRAC and keep it for monitoring. Clear the logs and check if the error still occurs.

"I've bought a new nVidia Quadro NVS-290 (PCI-E x1) video card.
It can successfully fit in any of the x8 slots.I've tried it in the n°5 as well as in n°1 slots.The card is well-seen by Windows 2008 R2 (driver installed and no error in the device manager).
But when connecting a monitor on any of the VGA cable (there are 2 on the NVS 290), either before boot or after, I don't get a signal and the monitor always turns into powersaving mode...
I've seen an option in the Unified Server Configurator where I can disable the on-board Matrox W200 video card.Is it the solution ?
But I'm a bit afraid to do that, because if the nVidia still doesn't work, I won't have the onboard-card any more either (so, how to re-enable blindly the default card ?) !
What's your opinion ?
Thanks in advance.



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","T610 works well with add on video so no need to worry.
Power off the machine, insert your new PCIe video card.
Reconnect power and boot your machine into BIOS and DISABLE on board video, save and exit BIOS. 
On reboot, at the splash screen, shut down the machine by holding the power button. 
Connect you monitor to the new video card and again boot the machine.
All should work fine. 
As AXI said, you can always restore BIOS to default by setting the NVRAM_CLR jumper on the motherboard.
Do note that by adding a video card, you will loose some of the iDRAC features like being able to remotely view the last boot screen (as the video is no longer via the iDRAC card). If this is important to you, then you need to reassess.
If you try this on a server without a BIOS option to DISABLE on board video, then you are likely to have problems wiyth add on video cards.

Let's first talk about the channels. You'll have your A bank and your B banks, which will be made of channels 0, 1, and 2 each. Channel 0 is A1 and A4 for processor 1 and B1 and B4 for processor 2. Slots 2 and 3 (for each bank) would have their own channels (IE channel 1 in the A bank is A2, but B2 in the B bank).
 
Do you know if your server is has one or two processors? If only one, we just need to be concerned with the A bank. If you have 2 processors, we'll want to populate the A bank correctly, then mirror that configuration to the B bank.
 
What I'd consider trying in a 2 proc config would be:
A1, B1: 32GB
A2, B2: 16GB
A3, B3: 16GB
 
Be advised though, this config may still not work. The manual doesn't explicitly call out support for 32GB DIMMs and I don't see any in my parts list. I do see some 16GB dual-rank RDIMMs, so I don't expect issues there. I'm just not 100% on the 32GB DIMMs. That said, they may still work fine.

I went into bios and disabled the alert and now I can boot. However, I can't understand why under Power Monitoring the ""Failure Threshold"" is 986W. Is this remnant of my previous 1100W PSU's? If so, how can I update? I'm going to purchase an additional two GPU's and want this sorted out first. Hardware > Power SuppliesInput wattage: 900Output Wattage: 1600Firmware: 00.3D.65/00.3D.64Part: 095HR5A01/095HR5A00I purchased iDRAC Enterprise license thinking it was a power cap set by the previous owner that was disabled in iDRAC express and I couldn't modify without the license but Cap is Disabled.

If a system with 1600 W AC PSU operates at low line 100–120 V AC, then the power rating per PSU is degraded to 800 W.  You'll have to use higher input voltage to take advantage of the 1600W PSU's
 
 
https://dell.to/3jOXeLZ
 
Page 32
NOTE: PSUs rated for 1600 W and higher require high-line voltage (200-240 V) to supply their rated capacity.
 
Page 138
NOTE: When you have more than two GPU cards on your system, you will need two 1100 W PSUs installed on your system.

"Hello! I was comparing server characteristics (power consumption, noise levels, etc) with the Estimated Enterprise Infrastructure Planning Tool ( http://dell-ui-eipt.azurewebsites.net/#/ ).(Very helpful tool by the way, just not so much advertised -- took me a while to find it.)So, I was comparing a T440 and a R440, that both host a Xeon 4210 and 2x280GB SATA SSDs (RAID-1 with PERC H740P) and 16GB of RAM.It all seemed reasonable to me, with the rack server pulling a bit more power and amps, but then I noticed something weird in the ""Sound Power"" section.It appears that the tool always reports more bels (so more noise) for the T440 server.For example, with a transactional load and CPU load of 30%, the T440 is said to produce 6.3 bels, while the R440 5.6 bels.I found this very weird since --from what I know-- towers server are designed to operate inside offices where noise is not very tolerated and since rack servers usually have smaller fans that need to spin faster and produce more noise.So, here are my questions:Are those reported noise levels correct or I am missing something in the configuration? Here is a link to my configuration (see 2nd and 3rd server -- the 1st is a R6415 that I also compare): https://mega.nz/file/NYM1wYzJ#Mzg4JHThRpauUGjPH59HIWDG6-3Fypg-Ql4wlkBD-1Y If they are correct, that means that both rack servers in my solution are more silent than the T440 tower?I have some trouble understanding why 1P AMD processors (e.g. AMD EPYC™ 7351P) consume so much less power than the 2P EPYCs (one third of the 2P consumption!!!), but I guess that is some hardware peculiarity, not a flaw in the estimation software, correct?I am pretty new to servers and I wanted to host my wannabe business in a silent and energy-efficient model (I do not want to invest in rack enclosures or extra cooling).Initially, I was considering a tower, thinking that it would be most silent and most power efficient option, but looking at these estimations I am realizing that maybe the rack servers are more silent and that I should choose the R6415 as the most silent and energy efficient solution (although, it might be more expensive to buy...).I am a bit lost here, so any hints are welcome. P.S.:The R6415 seems to miss the ""Idle"" workload mode. It would be nice to have a comparison of it against other servers in this mode. But I guess that would put those other servers in shame, because it would consume less than 50 Watts?

					Go to Solution.","Hello,
 
Congrats on starting your own business, and with our Dell servers, thanks!
 
The tool that you manage to use, is an ideal guide to show you some figures in an ideal environment. So, the tool may provide you some information but in an actual environment, the actual figures may vary. So, to answer if the reported levels are correct, yes it is but in an ideal environment.
 
Yes, rack servers are more silent, funny ain't it? I have a very similar case about sound cap feature on tower and rack. Only 14G rack servers have sound cap option. That option enables you to have a more silent fan running. Though, do have in mind that, servers need good ventilation.
 
On power consumption, it's definitely draws more power when you have 2 CPUs, as the hardware needed to run 2 CPUs are also doubled. 
 
My opinion best is to contact our sales rep if you need more information on the server's hardware. 
 
Do let me know if you have other questions.

If there's not an internal port, your drive would be exposed from the front or rear, so I wouldn't really recommend it. The H700 should be an excellent controller choice.

"Hello,
I am looking to upgrade the Intel Xeon E5-2407 (V1) cpu in a Dell T420.
Are the V2 and V3 versions of the E5-2400 series compatible?
Or do I have to stick to V1?

I don't think that V3 of E5-2400 processors are supported as only E5-2400 V2 are listed as compatible with T420. You may upgrade to V2. See a list of supported V2 processors on the table below:

"I have currently 6gb of ram (3x2gb PC3L-10600E 1333mhz). A1, A2, A3 : 2GB I just got hand on 2 x 16GB PC3-12800 1600mhz.From my reading, in the doc and dell website, I have found that if I want to conserve my 6GB I will need to put the 3x2GB in the slot A1, A2 and A3 and put my 2 16GB in A4 and A5. I've also read that all will go a a lower speed (1333mhz) A1, A2, A3 : 2GBA4, A5: 16GBI'm I right?Is it better to forget the 6GB (3X2GB) and only have 32GB but faster ram?Thanks for the help

					Go to Solution.","Which is better is really going to depend on your need. If you don't need more than 32GB, I would use the faster memory. That having been said, I'm not sure how much of a difference you would see in real world use between 1333 and 1600 clock speeds. Considering how much of an upgrade in memory 32GB is compared to 6GB, the 32GB would seem likely to me to be adequate. Let me know if you have any more questions about your server.

"Hello,i bought a dell poweredge r610 server. The bios firmware is very old and I get an error when I try to upgrade it. The current version is version 2.1.15. The version I want to upgrade is 6.6.0 version. I tried this on Windows, I ran the 6.6.0 bios update file. After waiting for a while, the warning came that instead of 2.1.15, the 6.6.0 upgrade would be processed and the server would be restarted. I pressed yes and waited for a while, and after waiting a few minutes on the black screen, the update failed. The server continues to boot with 2.1.15 firmware again.

The server is really out of date, trying to update it from its current version directly to the latest one can cause issues. 
 
When starting firmware version is too old is much better to update step by step. Instead of updating from a very old to the latest firmware version.
 
Check the downloads site and look for the oldest bios version available. For a R610 is the 6.1.0: https://dell.to/3dVsINv

"Our R410 server will be reconfigured to run 5 virtual machines, 3 running Server 2008r2 and 2 Windows Server 2003 Enterprise. The R410 has 2 Quad core Xeon E5620 procesors at 2.4ghz. My original thought was to replace the 16 gigs (8x2) with 4 new 16gb sticks brining up the memory to 64gb. I then went onto Crucial's and Kingston's sites and saw the 3x16 gb configuration. I chatted with both companies and now I am totally confused as to how much memory I should get and how it should be installed. They both told me to either get the 3x16 or 8x8 gb configuration to get to 64gb. After reading the whitepapers they told me to read I am so confused. I want to use the 16gb sticks so that we would have the option to max out the server at 128 gb if we wanted to in the future.
Can someone help me understand this and what should I get? The only thing I think I understood was that I needed to get the PC8500 Registered ECC memory if I wanted to use the 16gb modules.
I have a $1000 to spend and please tell me what to get.
Thanks and Happy Holidays!



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Take a look at the manual for the R410 regarding memory population:support.dell.com/.../HOM.pdf
And take a look at the UPDATED memory information from Dell regarding 16GB DIMM's:support.dell.com/.../TSen.pdf
Also remember that Dell does not set the rules - the memory controller's specifications come from INTEL and Dell's BIOS may vary slightly from that.
We are used to thinking of populating memory in pairs for greatest performance with as popular and common as dual-channel memory is, but some systems, including the R410, support three channels, meaning that configurations with 3 DIMM's (or multiples thereof) are the IDEAL configurations, as it allows the system to take advantage of 3-channel performance.  Non-ideal - or unbalanced - configurations result from not populating the memory the way the controller works best.
Remember also that ALL processors must have the EXACT same memory configuration.  So, if you put one DIMM in slot 1 of processor 1, then processor 2 must have a single (and matching) DIMM in its slot 1.  Like wise, if you have an 8GB DIMM in slot 1 and a 4GB DIMM in slot 2, this is considered ""unbalanced"" and will give you a warning in BIOS, but will work,  however, processor 2 must also have 8GB in slot 1 and 4GB in slot 2.
If you want to use 16GB DIMM's, to eventually upgrade to the max, that is fine, but you MUST use RDIMM's (UDIMM's larger than 2GB are not supported), for starters.  According to the docs, you put as many 16GB DIMM's in as you can afford right now, but with 2 processors, you can only do the following:
1x16GB per processor (2 total) for 32GB of RAM - populate in slot 1, which is channel 02x16GB per processor (4 total) for 64GB of RAM - populate in slots 1 and 2, which populates channels 0 and 13x16GB per processor (6 total) for 96GB of RAM - populate in slots 1, 2, and 3, which populates channels 0, 1, and 24x16GB per processor (8 total) for 128GB of RAM - populate in slots 1, 2, 3, and 4, adds a second DIMM to channel 0
Slots are labeled, starting nearest the processor, as 4 | 1 | 2 | 3.
The 3-DIMM/processor configurations are ideal, because it take advantage of all channels AND keeps memory running at 1333MHz ... if you use the 4-DIMM/processor configurations, yes,  you will have more memory available, but it will clock down to 1067MHz.  You may or may not see much affect/difference from the memory speed, but you may in some applications.

SWAPPED TO DIFFERNET CHASSISThanks for your reply, Stefan — I was nearly certain firmware update wouldn't work if I couldn't even probe to get the existing version so didn't think it was a good idea to try.  I get very anxious doing firmware updates for fear of bricking something.But interesting news! I swapped for a different chassis today and fans seem like they are WORKING great now. Still need to mess with the system to see if they are adjusting speed properly. There are SO many settings and data points available in iDRAC that I was not seeing before. As I'm new to Dell enterprise hardware I had no idea what I should be seeing. But a BIG clue to anyone else facing these types of symptoms -- I was not seeing power supply info, fan speeds and the message ""RAC0709: Unable to retrieve the fan information"" as I mentioned in original post were conditions suggesting that the sled was not properly communicating with the chassis.Once I powered up this chassis with only a single power supply inserted, I immediately got flashing power button and indicator lights that I hadn't seen on the previous chassis.So something was definitely wrong with that previous chassis.  Among the theories I have been mulling over that may have been the issue with the original chassis I had....missing cable connection somewhere (this seems most straightforward)bad fan controller/power distribution board (I think they are integrated together?)Other chassis was configured for C6320P and I was using C6320 sleds. In my research I found some information that said this could cause fan problems (perhaps in early firmware). Also note: RAC0709 error is listed in some Dell docs as ""Unknown Server Inserted Into Chassis"" instead of ""Unable to retrieve fan information"" as displayed under fan information when my sleds were in the other chassis.Corrupted firmwareIncompatible firmware (I've heard that if some firmware gets too far ahead of other firmware sometimes it is necessary to regress firmware versions in some devices in order to update the lagging one)Fan settings hard coded or corrupted by a previous user (although that doesn't explain why probing the board via IPMI failed)So here are what I think are clues that the sled(s) are not communicating with the chassis (my theory as to the issue I was facing)….No Fan Speeds in iDRAC + ""RAC0709: Unable to retrieve the fan information"" errorNo Power Supply Info (removing power in one PSU and/or removing secondary PSU should bring up error state and flashing lights on chassis)No Inlet Temp Sensors alongside CPU Temp readings in iDRACUnable to Probe FCB Firmware via IPMIAll that stuff and more now appears in my iDRAC interface.  Having not been a Dell or PowerEdge C user before I didn't know how much was missing.I still plan to update firmware and will update this thread with any info that might be helpful.   I can now probe for versions using IPMI….  so I think I have 1.25 versionipmitool -I lanplus -H 192.168.50.16 -U root -P ***** raw 0x30 0x1201 7e 1b 01 25 00 00 00 00 01 ff 00 01 24 2e ffff 0f c2 00 00 01 04 01 04 31 c5 11 ff 0f

"Could anyone verify which SFP's work for the C6320?  Or is there somewhere to activate/configure the ports?  When I look in BIOS/iDRAC/LifeCycle I believe that I am only seeing the default LOM slot info as if nothing has been inserted.I have tried PF911/Dell Part 407-BBOS which on Dell.com has C6320 listed as compatible.  I tried  both a Dell branded module as well as third party module that said it was compatible/interchangable with 407-BBOS.I also tried a random Avago ABCU-5700RZ that I had laying around and that didn't seem to do anything either.Can't get them to work on any of 3 or 4 sleds either so that makes me think the problem is incompatible SFP's unless there is some way to enable/disable them that I can't find.Should there be some sign of life for even an unsupported SFP?  These SFP's just act totally dead.  No lights, no information or errors when I am looking at LOM information in settings/idrac etc.I am assuming they should show some life even in pre-boot, so let me know if that is a mistake.  Lifecycle Controller needs one of them to be active for connectivity to that so I would imagine that they should be visible without an OS installed on the sled. 



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","UPDATE/RESOLUTIONTurns out all the SFP's were fine — there apparently was some issue with negotiation with the switch on the build bench.To troubleshoot, I had a DAC cable and plugged that in between sleds.  Lit right up.  So then I plugged the sleds into each other and all the SFP's for base-T, even non-Dell, worked fine talking to each other.   Then tried another switch and the SFP's lit right up.In my research on this problem, I had heard about some of these SFP's needing to be manually set to a speed to be backwards compatible with some switches, but in places such as iDRAC configuration, the link speed configuration options are dimmed…. probably because iDRAC is sharing those NIC's so it can't/shoudn't override the system configuration.  I don't see another place to configure this, however.I hope that in newer Dell software that (1) the presence of SFP's is better communicated, and (2) the status of a present/inserted LOM/SFP could also be shown (such as no cable/network connection).

Unfortunately, there's not a supported way to switch out the 3.5"" enclosure with the 2.5"" one. I'm not positive, but I think that enclosure may be permanently attached by rivets.

"Dear Dell Community,

I am new to the dell community. Recently I procured a new dell r720 server with two intel xeon six-core processors, 64 GB RAM, 2TBx4 SAS HDD with PERC H710P and an Nvidia Quadro K2000 GPU. Since the day it has arrived we have been able to successfully install CentOS 6.6 OS and every thing seems to be working fine. However, I would like to know as how I should proceed with the following matter:
During boot when I see the dell logo and the progress bar on my screen, if I press the F2 key to enter the system options, I get a blank screen with a cursor blinking in the top left corner of my screen. The system stays in this state until I power it off by pressing the power button or restart the machine by pressing Alt+Ctrl+Del. 
The same thing happens when I press the F11 key for PXE boot.
During boot when the system prompts to press the Ctrl-S key for network options and the Ctrl-R for RAID options, I can successfully access the network and RAID configurations.
If I insert a dvd and press no keys during the boot for accessing any options, the machine reads the dvd and I am able to install my OS. 
Is there some setting which need to be made or is there a hardware fault. How can I diagnose this issue? I hope I have expressed issue clearly. If any further information is required please do not hesitate to ask.
Best Regards

well, you did pretty much all the necessary steps to get the USC back to work, good job. The fact that it did not solve the issue shows that the flash seems to be corrupted somehow. From what I see, the only way to get the system back working is to get a replacement motherboard.
 
You might search for a part with that Dell part number F9NPY or even the whole Service Kit: MY04J.

"Hi All,
I recently inherited two R710's with the same specs. Both were quite behind on their BIOS and firmware updates (one was using 2.2.x the other 3.0.0) so I thought I would be a good idea to bring them up-to-date.
Using the Centos boot disk I flashed them both with the latest 6.4.0 BIOS BIN file. Both seemed to update fine, but following the update the server that was previously on BIOS ver 3.0.0 is now not showing any BIOS version at all!!
By that I mean that during POST the Dell screen says 'BIOS Version' and then nothing. Also if I go into the BIOS menu, no version is reported. Nor is it reported in any of the Dell utils / iDRAC.
The same server is also exhibiting some other BIOS related weirdness:
- it will no longer go into the F10 LC menu - it just freezes while loading.- Sometimes the Dell BIOS boot splash screen is corrupted. All I see is a blue gradient that starts half way down the screen.- In VMware ESXi VCenter the server Make/Model is not reported.
I tried to rectify these issues by clearing the CMOS - no joy. Flashing the 6.4.0 BIOS again - nope. I also upgraded all other firmware (RAID, iDRAC, NIC...etc) - no joy here either.
Finally I came across the Lifecycle Controller Repair Package. I flashed this using iDRAC and rebooted, It did nothing at all!!
So now I'm stuck. The system boots fine and will load an OS, but I'm feeling very uneasy about putting it into production. 
I've considered trying to flash BIOS 3.0.0 back onto the server, but I have no idea if you can downgrade the BIOS and have been afraid to try as even the BIOS flash tool does not seem to know what BIOS version I am currently on.



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Possible solution from one of our engineers...
He may want to try to force flash the new bios on from the dos utility on a usb key.  You just put the utility on a dos bootable usb, boot to that usb, run the utility, but instead of just running the command you run the command with a space “/forcetype” at the end of the command line.

For technical point of view, the components for a server to complete POST would be the ones listed below:
•System board•I/O board•Risers•Processor with heat sink•Power supply (power distribution board is required for redundant PSU)•CPU1 (minimum for troubleshooting)•At least two DIMMs in sockets A1, A2 (lock-step pair) to POST •Control panel with cable
 
There are to riser that needed for the server to complete POST, else the server will not complete it's POST, it will not proceed further.
 
Moving further, after complete POST, it would be OS components, which is RAID controller, Backplane and hard drives. 
 
You probably need to refer to the user guide for installation of components.

4x16gb kingstonn ktd-pe313lv/16gb
A1 - A2 , B1 - B2 ?
this mode the server say which ""ECC mode is disabled""




					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Tiagoheineck,

To clarify, you are seeing the server say that ECC is now disabled? Seeing that is likely due to the Memory Mode being set to ECC, but with a dimm present in A1 it will disable that memory mode.  To populate the server in Adv ECC mode would need the dimms to be in slot A2, A3, and B2, and B3.
If you set the servers Memory Mode to Optimizer then the dimms indeed would go to A1, A2, and B2, B3.
To verify the mode the server is set to just access the BIOS (F2 on startup) and then under Memory Settings, verify what Memory Operating Mode is listed as.
Lastly, although the R710 does support 16gb dimms, there are some processors that may not be compatible with using the 16gb dimms. Let me know what processor is installed and I can let you know compatibility. 
Let me know.

Ok, so let's get back to basics. Let's pick up a component and check its current version so we cant try to update it. I would suggest updating the iDRAC firmware first.
 
What is your current version? If it is too old, don't go straight to the latest version because this could cause errors. Instead, try the next firmware version. For example, this is the last iDRAC firmware version for the R620. 
 
Don't use this version directly. Scroll down till ""Version"" and select the next version to your current one. Then download the ""Update Package for Microsoft Windows 32 bits"" (a .exe). And make sure to follow this article Update Dell PowerEdge Servers firmware remotely using the iDRAC the part 3 for iDRAC7 or iDRAC8.

					Go to Solution.","Hello quistan,
 
Sorry to read that. It doesn't look good for me. What I think is that the server sufferend any kind of damage (electrical or physical) during the intervention. Did you use a ESD wrist strap? ESD is a major concern when handling components, especially expansion cards and system boards. Very slight charges can damage circuits in ways that may not be obvious, such as intermittent problems or a shortened product lifespan.
 
If this was the cause, you can try to clean the flea power. In order to do that follow this steps: How do I Reset and Drain Power of my Dell PowerEdge Server? 
 
By the way, a single LED indicator (only in position 1) means: Memory subsystem configuration activity is in progress. No memory modules were detected. Maybe the problem is only in the memory module.
 
Whad DIMM did you tried to use for the upgrade?
 
If this does not fix the problem, you need to try a Minimun to Post. Remove all components but the ones below and check if it boots:

The M630 is a Blade Server that is meant to be installed in the VRTX or M1000e enclosure.

Well, it could be difficult to say without a log analysis. Do you know if the chassis or the server nodes are still in warranty? If so, I could check the logs. Otherwise, you may need to check in the log events to see if you have any error message. 
 
You can also check firmware versions, as some of them may be out of date. And this could also be fixed in some firmware releases.
 
I've been looking for information and internal documents to see if we have something like this reported and I was not able to find any. So definitively, I would start checking logs and firmware.

So, 2 5TB drives shouldn't be an issue. Do note that unless you add a raid controller, at best you might be able to run firmware raid (supported by Windows and maybe Linux, but not things like BSD or VMware or so). 
If you were planning to run software raid, then obviously pretty much any OS should work with this.

"Hi all,
I've got a strange error on our 1081AD KVM, I can only launch a KVM session after a full reset, and during a few hours timeframe ( could not pinpoint exactly yet) , after that, I cannot launch it anymore.
Being more specific, I do a full factory reset, change passwords, change IP settings. In the next few hours, I can access the KVM, launch console sessions, no issue.
After a few hours time, when I try to launch a Java Session, it gives the error ""Could not connect to Server"". The error itself is pretty generic, and it is know from issues with Java, mainly due to security settings, like insecure/disabled ciphers , but his is not the case, Java Security settings are correct, the KVM is whitelisted, there are no proxies in between, no changes made on the client machine.
KVM has the latest firmware, version  01.20.00 from dellkvm.com , we also  know from experience that if we re-flash the firmware, it also works during a few hours, the flashing process does some kind of reset...
Steps already done/tried,  without success :
a) Older Java Releases (it needs 1.7+ to work)
b) Older Browsers (IE9, FF 45)
c) Other OS (Windows XP,  CentOS) 
d) KVM standard reboot

How are you launching the console, are you using the server console application? Try to access the embedded web server of the switch when the issue occurs.

The next time the issue occurs clear the volatile memory to see if that resolves the issue. You can clear volatile memory by disconnecting power to the switch for about 1 minute.

However I see that the chipset itself seems to support the 5600 series, but looking online it seems like the Rev 1 T410 might not.Regardless of official support, can anyone say that a 95w TDP 5600 CPU like the X5675 should work in a Rev 1 T410? Or is the 5600 series only working in the Rev 2?Insight would be appreciated because if I can get dual hexacore CPUs the server would be useful to me.

The Xeon 5600 series processors include a stepping revision of the Intel 5520 and 5500 chipset. This stepping revision is required to enable the full Xeon 5600 processor feature set. T410's with the new chipset revision will have the symbol II in the System Revision Field, which it sounds like you are saying yours does not. If that is the case the 5600 series won't be supported, now in regards to your question, the X5675 isn't actually supported on either revision of the T410.
 
Hope this helps.

"Server would not power on. Dell tech came and replaced the backplane and PER620 card and then left. The server will now power on but will not boot the existing volume or virtual drive. The server is remote to us and I’m guessing and hoping it’s a simple configuration issue with the new controller but how did the Dell tech know if they didn't see it boot up? The folks on site said the POST does recognize the 1 virtual drive.  But it does not boot up.  They tried to boot using the BIOS and the UEFI options.Is it something simple like setting the  virtual drive as bootable? I thought that some controllers could read the config from the disks?I was hoping there was maybe a tech note on getting the system to boot after replacing the back plane and or PER620 controller.

"Hi All,

I currently have two Dell Power Edge R720 servers. Both servers have redundant 1100W AC power supplies. Two weeks ago a power outage caused one power supply of each server to malfunction which were replaced under warranty by new power supplies. 
Since then the PS2 socket of both servers have been reporting an error, VLT0204 System board PS2 PG Fail voltage is outside of range. Contact support.
In order to solve the problem I powered off the system and disconnected the power cords and pressed the power button. I then swapped the power supplies re-connected the power cords and powered on the system. I repeated this step for the second server. Both the systems now did not report the VLT0204 error. 
However, the 'VLT0204 System board PS2 PG Fail voltage is outside of range. Contact support.' error message appeared on the front panel again. Repeating the steps above did not resolve the issue. I realised that this time the VLT0204 error became persistent. 
Just to be sure that the error is persistent I cleared the hardware logs after which I can still see a critical error in the iDRAC Server Health -> Voltages section.
I used the DSET to generate the server report logs which too shows the VLT0204 error message. I can provide the entire zip file if needed.

Should I ignore this error message or should I send it to Dell for inspection under warranty. 

Many Thanks 
Sohaib



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","MSI-PK,
If the #2 power supply is removed all together, do you still get the error even when it is removed? 
Also I would take the server to the Minimum hardware configuration, which is removing everything installed but the following;

One Power Supply
Control Panel (for power button functionality)
One Processor (CPU) in socket CPU1 (minimum for troubleshooting)
One Memory Module (DIMM) installed in socket A1
Riser 2 and 3 for single processor configuration OR Riser 1, 2, and 3 for dual processor configuration 

Power it up with that configuration, you can also swap out Power Supply 1 with 2 to test both power supplies under this configuration, and see if the error is still present. If so, then likely the motherboards voltage regulator was damaged in the power outage you had stated.
If the error does clear, try adding the removed parts back to the server individually until the return of the error shows which device is causing the issue. 
Let me know what you see.

Dell is only able to install the OS on a BOSS card, SD card, or an SAS/SATA drive. If the system is configured with the all-NVMe backplane, then Dell is able to install the OS on a NVMe drive.So as long as you order the system without an OS installed from the factory you are able to use an NVMe drive as boot in any configuration.

					Go to Solution.","Hello,The EOL date is 5 years from sale, with the exception being when hardware is available, it may extend that time to 7 years.  As for RHEL 8, if it is going to be designated as a supported OS, I wouldn't expect it for a quarter or two. Updates generally come out in quarterly releases and I wouldn't expect support for a quarter or two, depending on if this is something being worked on. I'm in the process of downloading a RHEL 8 .ISO, and I'd be happy to attempt to install it on a 12G and let you know if it succeeds, if you like.RHEL 8 is supported on the newer 13G and 14G platforms, however. EDIT: I was successful in installing RHEL 8 on an R620, and it appears to work just fine. In my case, the installer did not see the storage attached to the PERC H310 however, and I wound up installing to a USB. The RAID controller shows up in lspci as ""LSI Logic / Symbios Logic MegaRAID SAS 2008 [Falcon] (rev 03)."" I did not try manually loading a driver, but I did see that RHEL 8 uses a newer kernel, so I would not expect the RHEL 7 driver to work, since it was for an older kernel. You might try it, but from what I've seen so far, I would not expect it to work. I've seen a number of posts in other forums indicating that Redhat disabled support for these controllers, but I can't necessarily vouch for the accuracy of that information.

If you are accessing the iDrac and seeing them grayed out the first thing I would look at is if the Local Config using settings is Enabled. If you access the iDrac web interface, not the local server side connection, then got to iDrac Settings - Services - verify if the ""Disable iDrac Local Configuration is set to Enabled on either selection, as seen below.

When I first got this tower, it used this motherboard:
0CX0R0 / CX0R0
1 CPU and maybe 8 or 16GB RAM total.
I upgraded to 2x5670 192G RAM but always encountered this error (see event log even though DIMM3 was replaced with new RAM.
i upgraded to 2x5690 and that required a new board, so I replaced the board with 09CGW2 / 9CGW2, so now i have new CPU, new board and the error persists.
so I'm like ok it's gotta be the RAM. my ram is Kingston DDR3L-1600Mhz all 16GB modules. i think ECC Reg. so i replaced it with Micro DDR3 16GB modules x 2 sticks, 1 in A1 and 1in B1, this is a supported config, no config warnings when POSTing
 
am I supposed to move 2 stick of ram elsewhere not in A1 and B1?
 
Also why is the error persistent and always about DIMM3, currently there is no RAM stick in DIMM3, now remember. I have replaced my motherboard! it can't be the slot!
i'm at a loss here, i'm running latest FW across every components, i've rebooted, powered off, unplug power cord, discharge power button then plug in cord and powered it back. Reset all EFI settings/DRAC the works to no avail.
 
Should I give up on 16GB module dream for the T610 system and just go with something else? Is anyone else successfully using 16GB modules in any config (especially the max 192GB variety)? If so please let me know what brand model/make is. i can't buy all the models out there. the compatible RAM list is long aged.
 
does this chipset just like not 16GB?
 
closest error code (which is not marked in the evelogs of DRAC) is:
 



MEM1205



Memory mirror redundancy is lost. Check memory device at location(s) .
The memory may not be seated correctly, be misconfigured, or it may have failed.

Check the memory configuration . Reseat the memory modules. If error remains, swap test the memory module by swapping the module with another identical module in the system, see if the error follows the module or not. If the issue persists, Contact Support as a memory replacement might be needed
 








 
^i have combed through all that... remember i have purchased yet one ore vendor RAM! so not the RAM i dont think.
 
Also, 8GB, 4GB all does not exhibit this behavior regardless of B3 is occupied or not... only issue arises on 16GB RAM.
 
memtest86 all came back clean on all the RAM i have for this box

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
I would recommend making sure the firmware on the drive and controller are at the latest revision. You should also make sure you are using the latest version of the application used to monitor endurance. Updates may change how endurance is calculated or reported. It may also fix issues of incorrect reporting.
If both drives are at the same percentage then I would replace them now. If the endurance is accurate then once the drives reach 0% they will become read only. If you wait until that happens then whatever data is being written at that time may be corrupted.
I would replace one drive and then the other. If the storage controller and RAID level support a consistency check then I would run a consistency check before replacing any drives. A consistency check will verify virtual disk information and attempt to correct any faults that are found.

You can find the PCIE Routing Topology below, which shows you the slots and their associated CPU's

What I would suggest is clearing the hardware log and then remove the memory you added, just to test if the error repeats. If not then it may be the dimms, so let me know part numbers if you have them, so I may check on compatibility. I would also reseat the center and left risers, and the cards within. I would also look to see if the system is behind on BIOS, iDrac, and controller as well, if so I would recommend updating as well.

"Hello, I try to install three GPU Nvidia Tesla M60 in a Dell R740. I use GPU install kit, that come with a cable that have one connector with 6 pins, and the other connector have 6 pins + 2 pins. The Tesla M60 have a power connector with 8 pins. So...I connect 6+2 pins in Tesla GPU Power connector, and the other connector side in the mother board power supply. When i have the three GPU connected, the server don't power up. The PSUs are alerted (orange blinked). When disconnected the GPUs, the server power up.  The questions is: Its necesary and extra power cable to connect the GPUs to the power? I find in the Tesla manual, that is not compatible connect directly an PCIe cable power to GPU.Tesla M60 Cable Attachment Support Notes:CPU-8-pin auxiliary power cable attached: Supported; required. CPU 8-pin cable must be attached. CPU 8-pin cable must carry up to 240 W.PCIe 8-pin cable: Not supported. PCIe 8-pin cable is not compatible with CPU 8-pin board connector.

The GPU install kit, are you referring to this: https://dell.to/38Lv2mV, the GPU enablement kit. The power cable should connect to the riser power connector, located at the end of the riser. Try install 1 GPU at a time.
 
What PSU watt are you using? The PSU settings must be set to non-redundant.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Without knowing your electrical load, there's not a recommendation I could safely make. Most likely, you could use a pair of the 1100W PSUs and get along just fine. However, I would log into the iDRAC and you should be able to check your power balance at the System > Overview screen, if you scroll down a bit. For example, the system I'm looking at is using 313 watts. The Configuration > Power Management will also provide some insight on how your power is set up.
 
Once you know how much power is being used, you can figure how much additional power will be needed.

"Hi all,Recently I've been working on installing my Poweredge r610 server and I'm getting an error. I've been working on this for hours now but I can't figure out whats causing this.The error I'm getting says ""Fault detected in Drive 2"" (same error for drive 3). I've tried 2 different disks and also tried placing them in other slots. These drives are both very new and have pretty much not been used before placing them in the server. I've scanned them with a bunch of tools which both show no errors.When booting the server the orange flashing ligths become green. It also says it is loading all 3 virtual drives. My raid config utility shows no errors either. The drives are even detected by windows, useable and fast. While booting the lights start flashing orange again. I can still use them without any errors.Could anyone explain why I'm getting these errors? Thanks in advance!Please note that I am not a system administrator.

They may, but they may not. The messages will not disappear entirely. The best you can do with those drives is get them to show as online BUT with a non-critical flag/message regarding the drives' state.

"Hi,
I would like to know which of your PowerEdge servers provide PCIe slots for GPUs. I would like know some more details about it as well, i.e. how many slots, how many links, how many GPUs can be plug in, are there any limitations in size or model of GPUs?

Thanks,

					Go to Solution.","Dell PE servers like the Tx30's series towers, only supports compute cards when configured with the GPU Installation Kit and the gruntier PSU's at the time of placing your order. In this way, the server has the required GPU auxilary power connectors required by many compute cards that Dell certifies (along with other mechanical bits to presumably hold the cards safely).
However, it must be noted that Dell does not support graphics functions via PCIe graphics cards like the Quadro P4000 you mentioned. Dell only supports compute cards intended to provide processing grunt - not graphics :emotion-18:
Obviously that does not mean PCIe graphics features will not work in this server, only that Dell will not support such configurations if you have issues. In such cases where you have issues with graphics, or use of non certified cards, you'd be on your own.
Just be warned that should you install a graphics card into a PE server and it provides your graphics function, rather than offloading compute tasks, some management features may not be accessible (since they are provided to the DRAC by the integrated graphics which would be disabled ).
As a side note, the PE server i have looked at is teh T630 which is a 2 socket tower server that allows up to 4 GPU compute cards to be installed but dependant on a number of condiitions/configurations of the server itself. Other PE servers modles may differ as to the number of suppoted compute cards.
I've not seen any specific Dell doc that state which servers support which compute cards and how many they actually can support, so unless others know and can share you'll have to do lots of reading :emotion-43:
Finally, it must also be noted that the GPU Installation Kit is not a self installed kit that one can 'order' with the hope of 'upgrading' a server post sale. As such it's wrong to call it a kit which is why i hate it being called that, it should be called GPU Installation Option' within the Dell PE custom configuration web page! So don't expect you can buy a server and then later upgrade it with a simple kit you can buy. 
Good luck with your endevour :emotion-5:

					Go to Solution.","Hi Zanzaboo,
I'm not aware of anything we've done to specifically disable unsupported video cards, though we definitely cannot guarantee their compatibility nor have we tested or validated them in any configuration and for that reason do not recommend them. For supported graphics cards on the T420 (which you have correctly identified as the Q4000 and Q6000), you must disable embedded video output from the BIOS/System Setup under Integrated Devices (pg 30-31, support.dell.com/.../T420OMen.pdf ) to get video out. Note that when you do this, the iDRAC virtual console video output will no longer be available until embedded video is enabled again. I don't know of any reason you cannot follow the same steps with an unsupported graphics card but I must stress we did not test or validate it and if it doesn't work you would not have any recourse under warranty (i.e. we would not replace the motherboard for a faulty PCI-e port, for example). I'm not sure if PCI-e video passthrough will work on here, but you may need to configure the SR-IOV setting (right below the embedded video setting) per the needs of your hypervisor. Let us know how it goes, and good luck!

The main use for the server is for running SCADA, and the corresponding Report application. During the testing of the new server, (Dell PowerEdge R640) we determined that the speed at which reports are generated is 40% slower cca, compared to the old server. Benchmark test show that the speed of the old memory is 29 Gb/s , and the speed of the new one is 25Gb. The software developer  says that the Ram speed causes a slower report generation.

 

The seller delivered the server with a 4 x 16 Gb, DDR-4, double rank, ECC registered, 2666 MHz, memory which was installed into: A1, A7, A2, A8. We tried the to make a memory arrangement: A1, A2, A4, A5, and while starting up BIOS it reported a mistake.

The PC works with memories arranged in the order : A1, A2, A3, A5, but the report generation is still very slow.
How can we speed up the RAM?
The PC is two months old, we already had a SSCI failure, and we had to replace the motherboard (it was not possible to activate the server)…...

The issue wasn't simply from updating the BIOS, it is from skipping a large number of updates. Commonly the people you see reporting the issues from updating were due to jumping a large amount of updates, specifically the updates listed as Urgent. As each of the BIOS updates builds off the last, so skipping you can lose essential parts of the BIOS updates. With going from 1.1.1 to 2.8.0 you jumped 11 or 12 updates, so unfortunately it sounds like the BIOS is now corrupted, which would require replacing the motherboard.

I've checked the Intel website for the CPUs installed in the server (X5650) which says that they do support EPT. However, running SysInternals CoreInfo shows that the server does NOT support EPT.
Is there a BIOS option I need to configure to get SLAT/EPT enabled on the server. Virtualization Support is enabled already in BIOS.

					Go to Solution.","Hello
The TPM is 1.2. I don't know if the TPM is removable from the system board. It is not intended to be removed, the system board purchased determines the TPM installed. Removable TPMs were a feature of later generation servers. There are boards available without TPM, with TPM, and with TPM allowed in China/Russia.
If your board does not have TPM then you would need to install a system board with TPM.

"I have a rack of PowerEdge R810 servers.  Each server has 4x Intel Xeon E7-4870 CPUs.

I suggest clearing the NVram and see if the TPM failure message clears out, if not then it will likely require a new motherboard to resolve the error.  The jumpers for clearing the NVram can be found next to the coin battery on the motherboard. Poswer down the server and move jumper over, power the server to clear the nvram, power down afterwards and restore jumper to original location. After that then power up and let me know what you see.

The highest capacity validated drives were 14TB, but I wouldn't expect a higher capacity than that to cause issues. However, using non-validated drives may or may not work out. I would make sure to get them from a source with a good return policy, if you still want to try.
You'll need an add-in HBA, the HBA330 should suit your needs, though you may want to read up on it some. I'll link to the manual, so you can get any specific details you may want.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","red_gOOner,
The issue you are seeing is likely due to the server having been an OEM version R710. Which entails it being loaded with a custom BIOS. If the server was at the OEM 2.2.1 and then flashed back over to the standard BIOS, then it will continue to not show the BIOS information. What we will need to do is to
-Flashing the system with the 3.0.0 or later OEM bios update (using /forcetype switch) this will take the system back to OEM status.  
Then 
-Reboot and boot to Windows, run the 6.0.7 DUP, which will then apply successfully and turn the OEM box to Dell Branded, with bios versioning information this time being intact upon reboot. 
After that then you can update the BIOS back up to the latest version as you had. 
Let me know how it goes.

Your memory configuration is invalid because the memory channel  CH0, is not balanced with channels CH1 & CH2. Refer to the diagrammatic illustration below:

In order to balance the memory on these channels, we should have memory DIMMs in:                                   
A1, A2 &A3 = B1, B2 &B3 moreover also A4, A5 &A6 = B4, B5 &B6. Hence the memory modules on CH0, CH1 &CH2 have to be identical for optimal memory configuration and performance. Depending on how much memory upgrade you are looking to have, you may buy 1 more 16GB DIMM and then populate on slots A1&B1 to provide total capacity of 32GB. This will offer more flexibility for future memory upgrade

If you don't know the iDRAC password then you will either need to restart the system or use RACADM from the host OS, not a VM. By default, you can use RACADM from the host OS without authentication. You can also use a system management application like OpenManage Server Administrator from the host OS. OMSA will authenticate with an operating system password, not the iDRAC user/pass. You should be able to configure user accounts there as well. Using either RACADM or OMSA from the host OS will not require knowledge of the iDRAC user/pass unless that option has been changed in the iDRAC.

If you follow this link it will show the previous versions back to 1.0.4. What I HIGHLY recommend you do is walk it up to current, with the iDrac if you haven't already, as you don't want them to get too far apart. I would suggest downloading and running the ones marked Urgent, as well as not jumping more than like 3 updates at a time.

You should be able to select a boot device manually. A USB device will typically show up as a hard drive when manually selecting a boot device. If it is not seeing it as available or able to boot from it then the media may not be properly formatted. You can try another USB port, media, or a different boot loader. You can find documentation about settings on the R310 support page.

Alternatively, you could use the F11 key to access System Services, which is the Lifecycle Controller. You can pull the updates through the Platform Update option there.
One other option you might consider is the platform specific bootable .ISO. You would just boot the server to the image, and the image would bring all the firmware up to date.

It indicates the combination is unsupported. The CPUs must have matching specifications. If there is a difference between the CPUs in required specifications then the combination will be unsupported. This can be due to an unsupported CPU model combination or a faulty CPU.

I'm not familiar with the Tera 2 card. From what I can find searching online, it looks like a remote access controller for workstations.
The T640 has an integrated Dell EMC Remote Access Controller(iDRAC). I suggest that you use that controller instead of the workstation controller. The capability of the iDRAC is determined by the installed license. There may be additional hardware that can be installed for additional features, but the core functionality is integrated.
The Tera 2 card may work. I suggest reviewing the T640 specifications to see if it meets the requirements of the card. You can find documentation on the T640 support page.
http://www.dell.com/suppport/
Something to consider, the iDRAC uses the embedded GPU for video redirection. The embedded GPU is minimal, and redirecting video to another controller may cause conflicts with the iDRAC.

I show that the H330 is supported on the T140, so it will probably work.

There is no process or procedure to make this change, so there is not a part list of all necessary parts.

"We have 2 R815's connected to MD 3220i running esxi 4.1 free. Currently esxi is installed on the HDD. I am planning to add 2 SD card's in the R815 and install esxi on them. 

1. Can I use any SD cards? Is there a size limit?  I want to have the 2 cards in high  availability. I believe there is a BIos setting to do that.
2. Am planning to use PoserCli commands Get-VMHostFirmware -backupconfiguration and then the ""set"" command so I do not have to redo the configuration again.

Appreciate any comments.
Thanks

					Go to Solution.","They probably will, but I can't say for sure. I would recommend going with a class 10 card though.
Here is what I know about the IDSDM: It has no stated size limitations on SD cards. We only sell 1GB SD cards with it(on the R815). The 2GB SD card is listed as a valid replacement for the 1GB cards in my parts database for the R815.
There is not a lot of specs available on the IDSDM. It appears to be an extremely basic pass-through/converter that takes SD cards and presents them as USB 2.0 devices to the system board. According to documentation the IDSDMs in 11th and 12th generation servers are identical in functionality. I have 2GB SD modules in my R720. Based on all of this information 1 and 2GB modules should work without issue. Nothing states that larger sizes will not work, but we don't sell them in that configuration. The 8GB module is intended for Vflash. Here are the part numbers I have listed on the R815. You will need to call spare parts to order these:
0XW5C - 8GB Intended for Vflash(Vlash can use any size card up to 8GB) 738M1 - 2GB Intended for Vflash, but listed as a valid replacement for 1GB Modules P789K - 1GB Intended for SD Module RX790 - 1GB Intended for SD Module
The 8GB modules will likely work, but I would recommend testing before buying them for all of your servers. I'm sorry I can't be more specific, but the most detailed information I can locate on size limitations is in the technical guide book under SD module size it lists: Multiple.

"Recently, I fount the front LED is showing FAN0001 Fan 6 RPM is outside of range. But I do not have FAN 6 installed. Any hints? Thanks a lot.

					Go to Solution.","Dell_3,
The issue normally occurs when the system has an uncertified PCI-Express add-ons card installed, as well as the iDrac being out of date. It is just a false alarm with no functional impact to the system, so you can clear the SEL and it will back to normal till next iDRAC reset or AC power cycle. I would suggest getting the system to current on BIOS and iDrac and the error shouldn't occur anymore.

You are correct, there is no method to switch drive types in the virtual disk. Backups or images would be the best method for data retention. If you do an image copy then I suggest that you do not perform a copy that will include the virtual disk information. I would suggest a file system level image that you can copy to the new drives after creating the virtual disk.

Which components do the critical errors apply to?

- Unplug power cord and hold power button for 20 seconds - Firmware updates - Try reseating components - Replace parts
PS. I'm no longer under warranty

If port one is the only port with the issue, check the SIP cables out, try a server that is working on the other ports, on port 1 see if the issue stays with a port or follows the server.
If it is with all ports/servers attached. Then get a known good working monitor, ensure the server has good video output. Once confirmed then plug into the KVM and test for video. If both the Rack monitor and the known good monitor have no video when plugging into the kvm, then there may be an issue with that switch. And it would need to be further troubleshot or replaced.

"I have a PowerEdge T430 with 8x Samsung 830 DCT 960GB on a Perc H700 controller and Windows Server 2016 Datacenter in a RAID 0 setup (this is for testing).The single drives are 500+ MB/s read and write on the PERC H700 as a non-RAID disk.6 of them in RAID 0 was capped at ~1600 MB/s Read/Write. Adding 2 more drives to the RAID 0 produced no increase in speed. So 8 drive RAID 0 is also ~1600 MB/s.That doesn't seem right to me as I'd expect to increase speed as I add drives. The initial speed of 1600 for 6 drives seems around half of what it should be (shouldn't 6x 500MB/s drives be around 3k MB/s?)I'm not sure where the bottleneck is.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
This note should be in the installation instructions of power supply firmware:
IMPORTANT:After a successful power supply firmware download, the managed system turns off for a duration ranging from three to twenty minutes to continue updating the firmware. It is imperative not to interrupt/restart manually during this time. Update time can vary but should be approximately 10 minutes. Margin should be added to assure the Dell Update Package (DUP) is not interrupted (some DUPs may take up to 20 minutes). Once the firmware update is complete, the managed system reboots automatically.
If you interrupt the update process then the firmware may be corrupted. You can attempt to update the firmware again. If the firmware will not update with both PSUs installed then you can try with just the PSU installed that needs the update. If the system will not power on or allow the update with both or just the one PSU installed then you will likely need to replace the PSU.
Long restarts are normal during BIOS and firmware updates. You should avoid interrupting the update process. I would wait at least an hour for updates to complete before resorting to pulling the power or any other forceful shutdown/restart.

"Hi all, I’ve got a Dell R630 with a single SATA Controller. I just want to get into the SATA controller to initialize the SATAVdrive/create a volume. How do I do this? When booting I see the CD-rom and SATA drive recognised but there is no CTRL-S option. Also in the BIOS and Lifecycle controller there are no options to configure the drive. I can change the controller to AHCI/ATA/RAID etc. but that’s all. In devices I can see the network cards but not the SATA controller.

					Go to Solution.","Hello
If there is no more troubleshooting to be performed then you will need to replace parts. The iDRAC module should be part of a system board, so replacing the system board should correct issues with the iDRAC. If the iDRAC is not functional it could cause the LCD issues as well. I'm not sure if there are instructions about system board replacement in the documentation, but you may find other useful information.

"I updated the firmware today on my R820 server, which I have done on several other Dell PE's of similar if not the same model. This time something odd happened. The whole unit powered off and wouldn't come back on. I left it there for quite a few minutes to see if it was just doing it's thing and would power itself back on. The front of the server had lost power completely. I couldn't get the power button to work or anything. Eventually, I had to pull the plugs and then plug it back in and I was able to fire it up again.
Well, now I get a power supply configuration error detected error on boot. If I look at OpenManage, it says that PS1 is fine, gives me the readings, etc. If I look at PS2, it says NA for everything except it says Presence Detected Configuration Error.
They were both working fine prior to this update, so I dont know what happened.
Any way to resolve this for the power supply in question?
Thanks.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello Jason
It sounds like the FW update may have failed and the PSU will likely need to be replaced. I would suggest that you try to perform the FW update again. If that is not successful then you should try powering on the system with just PSU 2 in the system. If the PSUs are at different FW revisions then a mismatch will occur and one will be disabled, so PSU 2 may not come online with PSU 1 in the system.

"I am testing for disaster recovery for our T610 server. I have a second similar T610 server and using the SBS 2011 media and a Windows Server BMR backup from the production server attempted to restore to the ""testing"" server. Both have the same PERC Raid cards and I configured the second server to contain the same RAID 1 (os) and RAID 5 (Data) Virtual drives. I have gone thru the recovery process a few times. First I did it without installing any drivers and after restoring (and before rebooting) the system came up with the drive letters incorrect (system reserved was C: and the OS and Data drives were something like D: and E:). Before rebooting the restored computer I used diskpart to reassign drive letters (removing the drive letter from system reserved and assigning it as active in the process).  When I booted the system after removing the DVD it would only allow me to go into the repair mode (""start normally"" fails). Also, once in repair mode the drives are back to what they were before i changed them. I can change them again, but when I reboot they change back again, same scenario.  So, for the next try, I used the same procedure, but in addition to above, i added the PERC drivers during the process.  The behavior was the same except in this case the system reserved drive showed up in diskpart without a drive letter. But, after changing the other drive letters and rebooting, system reserved now has C; and the other drives have once again reverted to ""incorrect"" drive letters. And I still have a none restored system.  Each restore attempt take several hours due to the amount of data, so any guidance is greatly appreciated.Also, I did a check of the Production server and believe both systems are using BIOS rather than EUFI.Sincerely,Patrick



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","I found my answer finally from a PowerBiz Solutions article on the internet. The problem was described as being caused by having installed the NTBackup Restore Utility for Windows 7 and leaving it installed after migrating a Server from SBS2003 to SBS2011 as I had done.  It further explains that any future backups including BMR will not include contents of a specific folder c:\Windows\Registration if this condition exists.  The solution was simply to copy these files from the working server over onto a USB and then copying them into the same directory on the ""recovered"" server.  I did this and rebooted and the System came up fine, recovered to similar hardware on a different machine.  I believe the only thing I have to do now is remove the utility from the production server so the backups will be complete going forward. Hopefully others in the same situation can benefit from this information I was so fortunate to run across.Also, I think the drive letter assignments was never an issue in my case. I believe they were temporary assignment for the recovery environment, so naturally any changes I made would disappear upon reboot as I was no longer in that environment.-Patrick

"System configuration:Dell PowerEdge T110 IIBIOS 2.8.0RAM 2x8GB
For several reasons (e.g. PCI bus power) it is challenging to install an add-on graphics card in Dell PowerEdge T110 II.  The ATI Radeon HD 5450 is a good choice for the Dell PowerEdge T110 II because if its low (approx. 10W) power consumption.
After trying several HD 5450 graphics cards (listed below), one that works is a ""VisionTek Radeon HD 5450 - Graphics card - Radeon HD 5450 - 2 GB DDR3 - PCI Express 2.1 x16"". 
Edit: Thanks to paikat for following part numbers, (see his posting for links where to buy)...VisionTek Part# : 900356 Dell Part# : A6173020
This card works when the monitor is connected to VGA/D-SUB/DB15 connector. I did not try connecting to the HDMI or DVI connectors.
After installing this graphics card, the BIOS setup changed from:        Integrated Devices > Embedded Video Controller: Enabled
to saying:        Integrated Devices > Embedded Video Controller: Standard
and allowed to switch from ""Standard"" to ""Distributed"" so it now says:       Integrated Devices > Embedded Video Controller: Distributed
Note: Install the card with the monitor connected to the Integrated / On-board video port, change the BIOS settings to Distributed, reboot the computer, and then connect the monitor to the Discrete / Distributed / Add-on video port.
The following are identifiers on the ""VisionTek Radeon HD 5450 - Graphics card - Radeon HD 5450 - 2 GB DDR3 - PCI Express 2.1 x16""
54502GBPCVT 5450 PCIe 2GB V/D/HVT-400746PCPCB#R81KLD-PJ3ZR71KLDR81KLDVer: 1.0G0850000-0351L002739CZA-0087SH6 94V-0E248779
Here are some pictures of the  DELL VT 5450:




Other video cards that were tested and did NOT work well in the T110 II are:
* XFX AMD Radeon HD 5450 1GB GDDR3 VGA/DVI/HDMI Low-Profile PCI-Express Graphics Card HD545XZQH2;HD-545X-ZQH2 Note there is another version of this card i.e. ONXFX1PLS2 that was not tested.
* JATON Video-PX610GT-EX GeForce GT 610 2GB 128-Bit DDR3 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready Low Profile Ready Video Card
* DELL HIS H545H1G Radeon HD 5450 (Cedar) 1GB 64-Bit DDR3 PCI Express 2.1 x16
I hope this may help others avoid frustration when trying to install a video card in a Dell PowerEdge T110 II.

Also, are there any better options possibly with DDR5 and directx 12 support ? 
None that I know of, but I only tried a few cards. Please let us know if you find any better cards than the VisionTek 900356
I saw a thread suggesting ASUS GTX650-E-2GD5, anyone have any inputs about this card? 
I tried a GeForce GT 610 2GB and it did not work.  Check the power usage (TPD) of the  GTX650-E-2GD5 and ensure it is less than 25 watts (see below)
Side Notes:
1. The PCIe x16 slot is actually a ""full size x8 slot"" (also known as a x16/x8 slot) and the Video card needs to work in this type of slot.
2. Video Card wattage (TDP) is a limiting factor. Dell technical guide says ""The system supports 25 W maximum power for all four PCIe cards.""  and Dell owner's manual says ""CAUTION: To ensure proper cooling, no more than two of the four expansion cards can have a power consumption of greater than 15 W (up to 25 W maximum each), not including the integrated storage controller card."" 
3. Install the card with the monitor connected to the Integrated / On-board video port, change the BIOS Integrated Devices > Embedded Video Controller from ""Enabled"" / ""Standard"" to ""Distributed"", reboot the computer, and then connect the monitor to the Discrete / Distributed / Add-on video port.

"Hi All,After updating R810 BIOS to 2.11 I face strange problem with embedded graphics on several servers. After cold boot it does show ""Dell"" screen while configuring memory, after that it goes dark.server itself works fine I have access through idrac, no errors reported, built in diag software shows no problem, all memory/cpu tests pass  I tried to reflash bios / reset idrac and bios / turn it off (unplug all cables + hold power for 30 sec), changing VGA cables and monitors  but nothing seems to help. Out for 3 servers I updated 2 had issues. embedded graphics worked fine before update.

The F1 to continue error is commonly caused by a device being added to the server and not enabled, or that a port or device has been enabled and isn't present. Since this is happening systematically for you it doesn't sound like the case. 
Are you getting an error prior to the F1 prompt?
Can you power down the server and reseat the expansion cards, and any SATA cables. If that doesn't resolve try disabling the SATA controller in the BIOS. 
Can you take a screenshot of the error and post it?

We have only validated two memory modules for the T20. Both modules are 1.35v low voltage memory. 1.35v is not a listed requirement for memory. ECC is a listed requirement for memory. I think the main reason the memory is not working is because it is not ECC. Even though we haven't validated any 1.5v modules, I suspect it is capable of providing 1.5v to a module.
If you find memory that meets all of the listed requirements it may still not work. That is the reason we validate hardware for our servers. If you use hardware we haven't validated then you will be performing your own trial and error validation.

The H710 is not a validated controller for the x710 servers though - you should be using the H700 in that server. Either way, there is not a 4TB limit.

"So think I bricked my iDRAC card. Was going through updates, starting with getting the BIOS to 6.6. Then Started in on iDRAC, going from 1.3 (I believe) and going to 1.85, which failed from the OS (Server 2012 R2) noting something about failing a secure copy. Seen something on these forums about getting the firmimg.d6 and updating via web portal. So I did that and after a long wait the fans suddenly ramped up like it was rebooting and the fans just never went down. About 20 minutes later, which might not have been long enough to wait, I rebooted the server from the OS. When it comes back up it says ""System Services disabled,"" or something of the sort the F2 option, in the upper right and after getting the NICs and PERC up it hangs on ""initializing the Remote Access Card.""

"Hi.We have an R710 with an H700 controller with 5 physical disks in RAID-5 that we are swapping out to allow adding more space.  The disks have been swapped by using Offline/remove/replace with new unit/wait for Rebuilding to complete, then repeat steps for each disk.The array currently has a single Virtual Disk in MBR mode - which we plan to leaving alone, then add a second Virtual Disk configrured with GPT to allow a greater-than 2TB volume with the remaining added space.The old disks were 300GB each (all identical models either as DELL-branded or OEM Seagates).  The new ones are 2TB each - again all identical models bought in a batch: Seagate ST2000NM0045 Exos 7E8 Enterprise, 3.5"", SAS.The first 4 drives are all on Backplane Connector 0 (so ID as 0:0:0 through to 0:0:3) and all report space as;Capacity = 1,862.50GB,Used RAID Disk Space = 278.88GB andAvailable RAID Disk Space = 1,583.62GB.The last disk is on Connector 1 (so ID's as 1:0:4) reports the same Capacity and Used RAID space, but it reports the Available as 0.00GB.  So I'm being prevented from adding a new Virtual Disk, as the OMSA Wizard reports no free space.Our H700 controller details:Firmware Version 12.10.7-0001Driver Version 6.801.05.00Storport Driver Version 6.1.7601.18386I have tried removing and reinserting that last disk, but after the rebuild it still reports the same zero available.Could this relate to it being on the second Enclosure backplane (Connector 1)?I'm planning a reboot of the system overnight just in case a hardware-level restart is required - but I'd welcome any other guidance!

"We have an R620 that we recently added an LSI 12 GB SAS 9300-8e card to. The first time the server was booted there was no issue. Every time after that, it gets stuck at ""Initializing Firmware Interfaces"". I have tried disabling ""Collect Hardware Inventory at Boot"" and have disabled the Lifecycle Controller entirely. I have also used a bootable SUU to update the firmware. Nothing has helped. The only way I can get the server to boot up is to disable the PCIe slot that it is installed in through the BIOS, which gets the server running, but doesn't allow me to use the SAS card. Unfortunately, this is a production server in a 24/7 facility, but I have been able to take it offline for a couple of hours at night without affecting end users and troubleshoot remotely through the iDRAC.

"On a new install of ESXi 6.5 on a new PowerEdge R540 using an H330 HBA, sustained write speeds to an SSD volume in RAID 1 and a SATA volume in RAID 5 are approximately 20 MB/sec.  Symptoms are very similar to those described in this post:  https://anthonyspiteri.net/esxi-6-5-storage-performance-issues-fix/.  Unfortunately, the only driver available is a native lsi_mr3.  After disabling that driver using the ESXi shell, the volumes connected to the H330 are no longer shown.  I tried re-enabling the driver, but each time I reboot the driver is disabled, so the volumes are lost.  But that is a problem for another day.  The big question is:What other options are available to improve performance under ESXi 6.5 to SSD and SATA volumes connected via the H330?Is there a vmklinux driver that could be substituted in place of the native driver?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
Based on your description, it does not sound like you are using an H330 HBA. If you have RAID 1 and RAID 5 virtual disks created on the H330 then it is the H330 RAID controller. We have an article about performance expectations on controllers without cache, especially when using parity. 20MB/s sustained writes with RAID 5, SATA spindle drives, and a controller without cache does not sound abnormal to me. The performance impact of the RAID 5 will be felt on the RAID 1 with SSDs because the controller has to pause all I/O to perform parity calculations once the queue is full.
https://www.dell.com/support/article/sln164091/
If you go to the R540 support page and select ESXi 6.5 in the OS drop-down there is a category called Enterprise Solutions. That has the custom images we provide. The important information section lists all of the VIBs that we change in the image. The VIB listed there is the one validated for the PERC in that OS version.

"Hello all I need your help.
I have been trying to upgrade the BIOS of several Dell Poweredge R710's and for some reason I have been unsuccessful. Currently my BIOS is at version 1.2.6
I have tried the following.
1). Linux based ISO created form Repository Manager - It will act like its loading the update and ask me to reboot but when it goes to reboot it says BIOS attempt update failed. I have ran through this process about 50 times. All firmware and drivers are updated on the servers except the bios.
2) Loaded Win2008 and tried updating the BIOS through windows using the file ""R710_BIOS_4HKX2_WN64_6.4.0.EXE"" that I downloaded off Dells website. It runs successful then asks me to reboot. Once rebooted it mentions that the BIOS update attempt failed.
3) Created a bootable USB flashdrive. Copied the un-packaged file called ""R710-060004C.EXE"" to the USB flashdrive and renamed the file to conform to the 8.3 format. Booted to the USB flash drive and ran the program. It verifies the program then immediately fails with the error ""cannot use a dell system poweredge r710 bios in a "" -  "".
4) Tried updating from a non-bootable USB drive through system services using Unified Server Configurator. I used files ""R710-060004C.EXE"" and ""R710_BIOS_4HKX2_WN64_6.4.0.EXE"". It failed with the error message stating that I needed to use a valid catalog or windows file as it couldn't find one.
*Edit*
5) Just tried using a SUU package to do the update. Once again it looks like it applies the BIOS update ok and then asks for a reboot. Once rebooted it mentions that the BIOS update attempt failed.
For the life of me I can't get this to update. All the methods I have tried have not worked. If anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Jpalmieri_HDS,

The issue you are running into is that the R710 that you have has a customized BIOS, specifically created per the original customer. Now you can get the update to run and update the BIOS to the Dell standard, but you can't go back. So if there is software dependent on the custom BIOS, then you shouldn't update. If you are doing a clean OS install and such, then there shouldn't be an issue. 
I would recommend not going to the latest BIOS though, I would step it up. So I would start with this BIOS version, then walk up to the current. 
The process you will use is with the bootable USB, and non-packaged update. Boot to it as you did, but when you run the filename include /forcetype after it.
For example 
R710-060100C.exe /forcetype
That will force the update through, and after that you will be able to use the future BIOS updates from support.dell.com as they are released.
Let me know how it goes, and if this helps.

"Hello, I am trying to install Debian Wheezy 7.1 on my Poweredge 1950 III. I sucessfully managed to mount (just once) netinst 200mb + .iso image and to start installation via my Drac5 [fw v1.60].
However after long time of partitioning disks and so on it did not let me to install the new system, something like cd-rom unmounted, so i stucked on some step telling me some error about debian code or what. So till now, like 2+ hours I am trying to mount the same iso on the same machine via IE 9 or Firefox and no success. In Java it gives me always some session error when clicking to Map the disk and if not, then i dont see it after pushing F11 to see the Boot Device Menu, VIRTUAL CD-ROM is not there :/ seen it just once..Native almost always connects .iso, but I still dont see it in Boot Device Menu
I am a bit confused what to do to make it work. I've user auto-attach and java [not native] and not sure what to use in Boot Once Option [Virtual Media / Disabled / PXE]. And not even sure, when to mount, when the system is off, or when it is loading..?

Thanks in advance :]

It looks like Rac went into strange state, that could not attach my CD, but it acted like it did. System started to boot as twice as slow. Connecting to ssh rac, executing racadm reset soft, attaching .iso, restarting machine (voila machine boots 2x faster), going into Boot Device Menu and VIRTUAL CDROM and VIRTUAL FLOPPY is present, now I can boot again and continue installing :)
So the problem is on RAC, that it goes into some 'failure state' and behaves like it is ok, needs restart and then everything works!

"I have a pair of 2950's that cannot boot from a usb flash drive I have created. Both servers have the latest BIOS installed (2.6.2 I think). One is an original 2950, the other is a 2950-III. If I use the flash drive in one of our 1850's it boots up fine and appears to work correctly so I know the flash drive itself is fine. I have also tried another larger flash drive with the same results.
I have tried messing with all the BIOS settings I could find, even going as far as disabling all peripherals (RAID, DRAC, etc) or even physically removing them from the system. The only thing I encountered that might explain this is the USB Emulation setting. No matter what I do it ALWAYS gets stuck on the FLOPPY setting. I have a hunch that getting it to stick to AUTO or HARD DRIVE will make the flash drive work fine.
Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas on what the problem could be or how to do a full factory reset of the BIOS (in case some old setting is getting it stuck)?
Thanks

"HelloI need to upgrade the memory on the R320 and I've wondering if I can use the old ram to put it on the C6220Because those 2 servers are the same generation I hope I can use it !!!!Thank you



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
Maybe, if you get the model or part number from the memory you can search to see if it is for sale online. If it is for sale online then it would likely have a listing of compatible systems. You can also review the memory population rules on the C6220 to see if there would be any issues moving the memory.

"System: PowerEdge R910, 11GOperating System: RHEL/CentOS 7Issue: Deployment Toolkit v6.0.1 missing libstdc++ and libxml2 packagesBIOS and iDRAC firmware upgrades are being done remotely via iDRAC6 Enterprise.  This is an 11G server, so the firmware is no longer included as an update using the Lifecyle Controller.  Per article:https://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/sln296511/updating-dell-poweredge-servers-via-bootable...I downloaded the Deployment Toolkit for R910, and I'm mapping the ""ISOLinux.iso"" using the iDRAC6 virtual console's virtual media feature.The BIOS update to version 2.12.0 worked without problem.The iDRAC firmware update (version 2.85 to 2.90 using ESM_Firmware_9GJYW_LN32_2.90_A00.BIN) fails with the following error message:""The following packages are required for update package to run: compat-libstdc++-33.i686 libstdc++.i686 libxml2.i686""In my experience this type of error usually results from a 64-bit OS like RHEL/CentOS 7 attempting to run 32-bit software.Since I'm using the Deployment Toolkit on the ISO image mounted as virtual media, how do I resolve the dependencies? (The OS on the R910, and the machine I'm using to to perform the maintenance have the libstdc++ and libxml2 packages installed)This is an exclusively RHEL/CentOS environment, so I'm looking for a long-term maintenance solution NOT involving MS Windows.  Or is there an alternative update method for the iDRAC firmware that can be done remotely from a machine running RHEL/CentOS 7?

					Go to Solution.","We have 100% Linux environment - not a single server, or workstation running windows. Since Dell supports numerous Linux distros, it would be useful to get some Linux-specific hardware support.For Linux users: None of the toolkit software is needed for the iDRAC firmware update.SOLUTION:1. On any Linux client machine, browse to the associated dell.com/support for the service tag/server model.2. I was unable to get the iDRAC6 to accept the firmware image for RHEL 7/CentOS 7 (""ESM_Firmware_9GJYW_LN32_2.90_A00.BIN"") using the iDRAC web gui > iDRAC > upgrade > upload feature.  Alternatively, I extracted the firmware image from the Windows Server 2003 archive (step 3). Yes,3. Select OS: Windows 2003 server and download ""Dell iDRAC Monolithic Release 2.90"", file ""ESM_Firmware_9GJYW_WN32_2.90_A00.EXE"".4. On Linux client machine, use any archive management software that can handle Windows archive EXE file to extract files. Using the ""unzip"" program via command line:cd ~/Downloads/mkdir idrac6_firmware_2.90cd idrac6_firmware_2.90/unzip ESM_Firmware_9GJYW_WN32_2.90_A00.EXE*** NOTE: The only relevant file is payload > ""firmimg.d6""    5. I had numerous failures uploading and installing the firmware image using the iDRAC6 web GUI, so I recommend rebooting both the client machine with fresh browser session,  and the iDRAC. To avoid a factory reset of the iDRAC and lose settigs, a soft-reset can be easily via secure shelle:Client machine's command line:ssh yourLoginName@yourIDRACipAddresspassword:/admin1-> racadm racreset6. Give the iDRAC a 5 minutes  to reboot. On your Linux client machine use a browser to log into the iDRAC through the web gui.7. Browse to iDRAC Settings > Update > click Browse > select ~/Downloads/idrac_firmware_2.90/payload/firmimg.d6 (or wherever the firmware image was extracted).8. ""Upload (Step 1 of 3) > Click upload. Do NOT browse off of the iDRAC upload page.9. If the upload is successful you will see ""Status (2 of 3)"", showing current version number and new version number. If it fails/hangs try rebooting your client and browser session.10. Click ""next"" button11. The installation of the firmware should start and show ""Updating (Step 3 of 3)"" and periodically update the ""status"" box.  Do NOT browse off of the iDRAC installation page. Mine took about 10 minutes and spent several minutes before jumping to each of 0%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% values.   Let it run. If you see a spinning wheel, or a message like ""The firmware is updating, try again later"", start over at step 5.12. If the installation is successful, you will get a new message confirming it, and indicating that the current session is no longer valid. The iDRAC is automatically rebooting with the new firmware.  Give it several minutes - mine took 5+ minutes.

					Go to Solution.","Thanks, but some tech on Dell Italy said me that changing to H710 is not secure, maybe we have to backup and restore all installation ? Is it true ?
Absolutely incorrect. There is nothing ""insecure"" about the H7x0 controllers. You should not need to do a backup/restore to go from an H310 to an H710 - the H710 should pick up the virtual disk from the H710.
Changing the controller will not require a backup/restore, but changing to SSD will. You cannot mix HDD and SSD in the same virtual disk (array), so you could not swap/rebuild one drive at a time to change them out.

You probably have a faulty memory module. When a module fails, memory that is dependent on that module will be disabled. You can run diagnostics, review logs, and move memory around to troubleshoot memory issues. You can find more information in the documentation on the system support page.

If there is an error light on the system then the error should be reported to the hardware/system log on the iDRAC/BMC. You can view the log by booting to the iDRAC/BMC via CTL E or by installing one of our management utilities like OMSA:
http://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER00333144M/1/OM-SrvAdmin-Dell-Web-WIN-7.0.0-4741_A00.exe
OME is a monitoring application to manage multiple servers. It has several installation requirements. OMSA has install requirement, but is easier to install and use than OME. OMSA is designed to manage the server it is installed on.

I put the logs in a spoiler tag to make the thread easier to read. In the future, if you want to add logs to a thread then please either attach a file or provide a URL to a text sharing site instead of copying and pasting logs into a post. Log snippets are fine, but large snippets or full logs don't belong in the post body.
These look like bad block errors to me. Bad blocks happen with drives, they are fairly common. If multiple bad blocks are found on a drive then it could be a sign that the drive is going to fail. Once the disk crosses a threshold for bad blocks the SMART on the disk will report the drive as predictive failure. If I had several drives that were reporting bad blocks then I would be proactive about replacing them. If it was just one drive and I had good backups then I would wait for it to go predictive failure before replacing. I didn't notice any of the drives being predictive failure in the logs.
I would also run a consistency check. It is good to run consistency checks at regular intervals or when disk issues are encountered. A consistency check will verify the data is intact. You can find more information in the controller manual.

"I bought a used C6220 II system board 0083N0 which has BIOS 3.2.11 from 2014. I would like to update that, but all current BIOS for C6220/C8220 series are 2.x. I haven't been able to figure out what that old 3.2.11 is and if it is safe to update to current 2.9 or similar?

					Go to Solution.","Hello
That is not a C6220/II board. It is a system board for one of our Data Center Solutions products that are based on the Cloud line of products. The DCS line of servers are custom solutions that may use hardware, BIOS, or firmware that is specific to the customer the solution was created. Any custom BIOS or firmware created for a customer is only available to that customer.
I would not use that system board in a normal C6220 II. If you are not having any issues then I would not change the BIOS.

					Go to Solution.","Hello
It sounds like the DRAC is either not installed or not functional. The CTL E BMC/DRAC menu is available whether a DRAC is installed or not. If a DRAC is installed the BMC/DRAC menu should list a Remote Access Controller revision. You will also have a couple of extra options, like virtual media configuration. If those are not present then the DRAC is either not functional or not installed. You can find more information in the manuals.
http://www.dell.com/support/
http://www.dell.com/esmmanuals/
The DRAC manuals should be under DRAC and BMC manuals should be under Remote Enterprise Systems Management on the Embedded Server Management manuals link. The system manuals are on the system support page.

The R230 server supports only ECC UDIMMs. The system is not booting because the memory you bought are RDIMMs which is not supported on this server. Consider using UDIMMs which have been recommended to you by Dell support. Further, RDIMMs and UDIMMs can not be mixed in any memory configuration

"Hi,
How are you guys doing today? hope all is well... : )
When I turned my T620 on today, I heard a pop and something smelled burned. A quick look at the front info display and the back of the computer, confirmed what I suspected:
One of the PSU's is kaputt!
Luckily I have two! Anyhow. I did a quick search on eBay and found the one I currently have, which is the L1100E-S0. However, I also came across one that looks pretty much the same but it is called L1100A-S0.
The E is around $90 bucks and the A is around $30. 
That said. I hate being cheap, and luckily I don't have to be, but why spend 3 times as much???

Any ideas what the difference is between the two?
Also, could I get a PSU with more watts and use it in my T620 that has a 1100 watt PSU?

Thanks,
G

P.s. Do these power supplies have a Fuse? If so, are those replaceable? Whit out having the skill level of an electrical engineer, ha ha.

These are model numbers based on circuit modifications. Different models support different server generations. The L1100E-S0 model is mostly supported on 12 Gen servers including T620 whereas L1100A-S0 is supported on 11 Gen servers.
Also, could I get a PSU with more watts and use it in my T620 that has a 1100 watt PSU?
The maximum power wattage supported on T620 is 1100 W and no more.

They should but we do not advise replacing internal electrical components. You do it at your own risk

					Go to Solution.","Hi,Thanks for the controller log. I see that drive 1 failed due to timeouts back in November and was replaced by the hot spare. Drive 1 was then copyback by drive 3 which was the hot spare and inserted back into the virtual drive. There weren't any errors being reported on drive 1. The timeouts could be caused by another drive. Drive 0 has had several block errors (sense code 3:11:0 Medium Error - unrecovered read error)  and continues to do so. it will probably go predictive fail in the future after enough errors occur. You can wait for the drive to go predictive fail and replace at that point or proactively replace. Seeing that the medium error is being recovered.

"Hello and thanks in advance for any help and suggestions.I've got a PE-T620 With CentOS on a 500GB (4PD) RAID1 array and 10TB storage (4PD) RAID 10 array.The last disk on my storage array was flashing amber. The PERC utility showed SMART errors were present, all info about amber flashing said predictive failure, and processes that involved moving large packets of data were extremely slower than usual.The 4 drives in my RAID10 array are WL5000GSA6454 (5TB SATA III). I misplaced the spare I had in my IT closet so I shopped all over not finding a 5TB SATA / NAS drive that could be delivered anytime in this century. I ended up getting a 6TB thinking it will rebuild the array using 5TB and I'd waste 1TB but at least the array would be healthy and we'd recover lost performance.When the drive arrived, I was unsure about hot swap-ability so I went into the PERC utility to see if I could force the drive offline. There was an option but the warning message said doing so would ruin my array. The other option was ""replace member"", when I chose it, the message said, ""No spare configured"". Since all my bays are in use, I can't configure a spare.I ended up turning the server off, replacing the drive, and booting back up. No lights on the new drive carriage during boot or otherwise. I went back into PERC and it just says MISSING DISK. I put the old drive in, still says MISSING DISK. I don't see any option to add a new disk, initialize the new disk, or do anything that seems conducive.The data on that RAID10 array is mission critical. We have online backups but I'd much rather just get the array rebuilt with this new drive if possible.Either I'm missing some setting or option to get the drive going, or I have to get the same drive as the other 3 in the array. My experience with RAID says as long as the drive is equal or larger than the other members it can be used, but if it's bigger, we'll only be able to utilize as much space as the smallest member in the array.Right now the OS is bootable with that 4th PD missing but I have it off because I'm scared something may happen that will result in data loss or worse.Any help would be greatly appreciated!

You would likely need to move the drives to the other side of the backplane, in order to be visible to the controller. You shouldn't need to do anything beyond that I don't believe, but you may have a foreign configuration. If that is the case then import the foreign to proceed.
Let me know how it goes.

"I have a brand new DELL PE R610, straight out of the box. However I am experiencing major issues with it when I'm trying to install Windows Server OS.
Boot up is fine, no errors (Also ran Diagnostics and it is fine).
Configure the RAID no issues (have tried every possible config of RAID to prove it was not that)
The system goes through the SBUU with no errors, configures the RAID, pre-installs the OS etc and reboots cleanly. I'm then prompted to insert the OS CD which it reads and I start the install. It goes through the first few steps and gets to the point where it asks me to select where I want to install Windows. At this stage it fails, with the error:

I have tried using diskpart to create/modify/delete partitions etc, refresh the disks but get the same error again and again.I just can't create that system partition that Windows needs !!
The interweb has lots of examples pointing to this error, a lot of them factored around disabling/removing disks etc, but I don't believe that is the problem. What I have noticed is that when I go into System Services (UEFI) on the Home Screen it gives me a warning that a system update is recommended since some components are potentially out of date. Great, sounds logical to me. However I try to go via Platform Update to do this, after configuring a network adapter, but it does not like it.
So essentially this is a 2 part question: How do I get around the WIndows Install error? And how do I run a systems update without the ability to get on the internet - I can't find any location to download an iso image that I could use or similar?
Desperate for help, and being in Africa does not help me as there is no DELL support here.

"Hi all, I am trying to install Windows Server Essentials 2016 on a T320. I am using a USB key as the boot media. Everything loads fine, until the computer restarts after the initial phase and then I get the windows logo screen. At first it is a high resolution screen then downgrades to a low resolution image with the circle of dots surrounding the windows logo and then nothing happens. If I do a cold restart at that point the installation fails and I have to start from scratch. I am thinking it's a driver issue? I cannot deploy Server 2016 through the LLC as it is not one of the available options, however Dell has certified Server 2016 as an option for T320. At installation, Server 2016 recognized the hard drive and all, no issues there. I have a Raid 10 array of SSDs with one VD already configured for OS deployment. I guess my only other option would be to install Server 2012 R2 and do an in-place upgrade to 2016? Any ideas from anyone would be welcome.

Pick the matrox video driver. After that everything went buttery smooth.The frustrating thing is that this is a very simple issue to have a workaround, yet there is no mention anywhere in the Dell tech support documents, even though quite a number of 12th generation servers that have been certified as compatible with Server 2016 (I do remember somewhere in some obscure document a mention that the video card is an issue with server 2016, but there was no advice given). Better yet, Dell should just make Server 2016 an option in the lifecycle controller OS deployment ->it would make life easier for everyone since most other drivers are inbox with the server 2016 installation media. As well, check the device manager after install (right click on ""this pc"" on the desktop and select properties, then look in the upper left corner -> I had to manually install a number of drivers from windows update ->just right click on any devices that server 2016 did not recognize and pick update driver. Cheers.

"The situation is as follows:I have a PowerEdge T620 that has had a failed drive in an unknown RAID configuration for a year now (!). According to the T620 manual, I need to disable the faulty drive through iDRAC before I can replace it and rebuild the array. Unfortunately, I don't have the login credentials for the iDRAC - the server was set up by a technology consultancy which claims to have already deleted/passed on all relevant password data (They did, but overlooked the iDRAC credentials when doing so...).The server is running ESXi 5 with several mission critical Windows Server 2012 R2 VMs. My goal is to reset the iDRAC password (perhaps using OMSA?) WITHOUT triggering a reboot, so that I can replace the failed drive, add a hot spare or two, and rest easy. Is this possible? I've tried using racadm, but uinstalled it after getting an ""Unable to communicate with the BMC"" error. I'm wary of installing OMSA because I don't want it to trigger a reboot, but if that fear is unwarranted I'd be willing to try it.I have access to vCenter, ESXi (over SSH), and all of the Windows VMs. Just not the iDRAC. I'm also almost 100% sure that the username is root or administrator, but don't know the password (not that that helps much).I'll answer any questions as best I can. Any and all help is greatly appreciated!

					Go to Solution.","You have to install it on the host OS, it won’t pass through the commands to a VM. That is also why racadm didn’t work installed on a VM. As for pulling the drive, it is fine most of the time, but it would be better to do it with offlining the drive first, but if you can’t have downtime that is better than leaving the array degraded. Having downtime to reconfigure the drac is the best option though.

The massage on the screen says that “the server does not support existing configuration of memory.”
Refer to the diagram below.

For optimal memory configuration, the memory installed on slots on CH0, CH1 and CH2 of CPU1 have to be balanced and hence the same. The same applies to the memory on slots of channels CH0, CH1 and CH2 of CPU2. Therefore, memory on all channels on CPU1 &CPU2 should be the same. You will need to use 4 x16GB and 4 x8GB modules with 16 GB populated on slots with white sleeves and 8 GB on black sleeves while leaving channels CH0 empty (96 GB in total). Otherwise, the configuration will not be supported.
Currently, they have installed 4x16 and 4x8.. Which give us 96gb. But they say that the rest 4x8GB are incompatible with currently installed. Is this possible at all? The rest of 8gb memory sticks have same speed and type as those, that are currently installed
With the above configuration, you can not introduce 4 x8GB modules because now channels CH0 on CPU1 and CPU2 will not be balanced with the rest.
Is there a way to make it 128 ? please advice!
Yes you can, by using 8 x16GB modules which may not be cost effective. Otherwise, purchase 2 additional 16 GB modules and use 6 x16GB and 6 x8GB modules as follows:
A1, A2 &A3 and B1, B2 &B3 = 16GB
A4, A5 &A6 and B4, B5 &B6 = 8GB
This will provide you with total memory capacity of 144 GB

The first two things I would start with is to update the server, as well as the H310, to current on updates. After that is done then I would perform a Consistency Check on the Virtual Disk. To run the Consistency Check you need to start OpenManage from the OS and then do the following;

Locate the controller on which the virtual disk resides in the tree view.
Expand the controller object until the ""Virtual Disks object is displayed.
Select the 'Check Consistency' task from the virtual disks's drop-down menu.
Click Execute.

After those two things the replacement drive shouldn't be showing the Predicted Failure, but if it does we need to run a SupportAssist report, so that I can check on a double fault or puncture to the parity. 
Let me know what you see.

I would start with making sure the server is up to date. Normally issues like this are due to it being very behind in updates, but you may also want to clear the hardware logs as well.
Let me know if this helps.

"Hi,I've inherited a T410 which came with 2x8GB RAM RDIMMS, in slots A1 and B1. The server was happy with this. Dual CPU configuration.I wanted to add more RAM so I thought it simplest to add another 2x8GB RDIMMS. These came but there is a very minor difference, they are dual rank while the originals are single rank. The hardware manual says you can mix single and dual ranks, but doesn't give guidance about where to put them. It suggests slots A1/A2 and B1/B2 should be filled in this configuration for 'optimizer' modeEvery possible configuration of single and dual rank (each CPU has single or dual, split single/dual to have identical configurations per CPU etc etc, different slots) all give various errors either 'sub-optimal' or 'unsupported configuration'If I use A1/B1 Dual rank and A2/B2 single rank it says 'unsupported, DIMM geometry should match A1/A2 and B1/B2'If I use A1/A2 dual rank and B1/B2 single rank it says unsupported: CPU config should matchIf I use A1/B1 dual rank and A4/B4 single rank it says 'non-optimal, something about a mismatchCan someone please tell me what configuration of 4x8GB (2 SR and 2 DR) should be used for maximum support/compatibility? I understand an error might persist since technically geometry doesn't match, but if I could be advised which error is 'best' that would be good. Should I try to make each CPU identical or put all the single on one CPU and all the dual on another?Thanks



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
The T410 has an odd memory layout. It is tri-channel with four channels. Slots 1,2,3 are a memory grouping and slot 4 is a grouping. Memory should not be mixed within a grouping, that is why you keep getting geometry warnings. Also, you typically want to install memory in pairs at a minimum. Because of all of these guidelines there is not a good population for mixed memory in the T410.
Your best population would be to put the higher rank modules in slots 1 and the lower rank modules in slot 4. Also, flexible memory is a feature that was added with our 12th generation servers. We added this feature to some of our 11th generation servers with BIOS updates. Make sure your BIOS is up to date. If the flexible memory configuration feature was added with a BIOS update then it will allow you to run a lot more memory configurations. You can find downloads and manuals on the server support page.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
Some of our servers have an option in the BMC or System BIOS to enable or disable (F1) stop on error. I reviewed the BIOS settings for the 2950 and did not see that option. You can try clearing the system event/hardware log and restarting the system. You may want to view the system event log before clearing it to see if any other errors are reported. I think the commands to clear and restart would be something like this:
racadm clrselracadm serveraction powercycle
You can verify the correct syntax in the racadm CLI guide. It should be on the support page of OpenManage Server Administrator. The last version of OMSA I show supported on the 2950 is 7.4, so I would look on the support page of OMSA 7.4.

If clearing the log does not resolve the issue then you are probably going to need to locate the server. There may be some other issue keeping the system from booting and the DRAC embedded web server from working.

					Go to Solution.","Hello
I found an internal document that is likely related to your issue.
If a switch is installed on the A fabric that does not support all 4 ports of the LOM then it will cause firmware mismatch issues if the firmware on the LOM is updated. When a FW update is performed on the LOM it will only update the chip that controls two of the ports, the second chip that controls the other two ports will not be updated. This will affect the ability of flexaddress to work properly. These are the steps to resolve the issue:

Remove I/O modules from the A fabric
Reseat and reboot the blade
Perform another FW update on the LOM
Reset/restart iDRAC and verify it reports all 4 ports at the same FW revision
Power down blade
Reinstall I/O modules
Power blade back on

If you have a data handling policy then it would be best to follow that policy. You will likely need to attach the drive to a pass-through controller of some type to use data destruction software.
If you want to use the controller to wipe the data then you can create a single drive RAID 0 with the drive. During virtual disk creation you can choose the option to perform a full initialization. A full initialization will write zeroes to the drive.

Replace the system board.
The iDRAC needs to initialize to be able to update it. Sometimes the iDRAC will partially initialize and allow an update.
Before replacing the system board I would take the system to minimum-to-POST, drain flea power, and clear NVRAM via jumper. If you notice anything that would hint at a problem with any other hardware in the system then troubleshoot that issue and try to resolve it. Almost any faulty or incompatible hardware can cause issues with other hardware in the system.

I found a couple firmware updates for the x520-k. The most recent is compatible with 6.5.. so I applied the next most recent that works with 6.0 and it didn't help.Everything I've checked shows this equipment is supported on ESXi 6.0, and I have all the recommended firmware/driver versions.As a workaround, I discovered administratively cycling the nics fixes the problem (esxcli network nic down -n vmnicX, esxcli network nic up -n vmnicX).  I've also considered separating the vMotion and VM network nics but I have no good options there - either I lose back end switch redundancy for some things, or when the problem happens I take down management or iSCSi instead of the VM networks.  Going back to 5.5 is a terrible option as I'm trying to get us to vCenter 6.7, which doesn't support 5.5.

					Go to Solution.","Natman357,
I believe the issue you are seeing is due to you having the Express version of the iDrac, and not the Enterprise. In order to use the Virtual Console and Virtual Media features you would have to have the Enterprise version. So even if the tab was to return, unless you upgrade iDracs then it wouldn't be functional anyways. You can see the supported options available for the iDrac Express here, on page 21-22.
 
Let me know if this helps.

"Hi 
we are using 2,  R910 poweredge rack servers, but eventually.... one of them stopped working, when our techinical team checked the server. but server does not powered on ... no display but giving the error E1234 Riser A error ..., when we replaced the other  server board and riser it doesnot work ... then we placed the board to the actuall server 1 it also stopped working .... what should we do ... plz reply ....:) 




					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello.
System E1234 error is indicative of memory riser power failure that may be caused by either the DIMM(s) on the riser or the raise itself. The first thing you do is to power down the server and reseat the riser and associated DIMMs. However, it is also possible that it could be a system board issue. Have you done any troubleshooting to truck down the source of the error?  
Just replacing the system board may not solve the problem. You might consider swapping the riser and when the error follows the riser; swap the DIMMs as well. This will point you to replacing either the riser or DIMM(s). But when the errors stays in the same riser position, then it could be a system board issue.

"We have a brand new R320 server with iDRAC7 that is well and truly locked up due to extraordinary circumstances. The server deployment and OS installation were interrupted due to a system crash elsewhere that also destroyed necessary configuration information.
As a result, we are left with a server in which:

iDRAC root password is unknown,
local console access is disabled in iDRAC settings, and
there is no functioning server OS installation.

We want to reset iDRAC to factory defaults to start over, but cannot find a way to accomplish this.
We cannot boot to BIOS setup (F2) to reset to defaults as the local console is disabled by iDRAC. Talk about a chicken and an egg: console which is disabled would be enabled by the hard reset, but to complete the reset you would need the console. Argh.
We cannot log on to iDRAC remote console as we do not have the root password, which also keeps us from running DRAC tools remotely. We could run racadm locally without credentials, but that would require a local OS installation in the server, which we do not have.
What we need is a hard, hard reset of iDRAC without local console or iDRAC root. All we have is unlimited physical access to the server, that's all.
How can we do that? Is there a physical switch, jumper, whatever somewhere to euthanize iDRAC for good? A diagnostic boot gizmo of some description? I am thinking of e.g. the vFlash slot. Is there a special boot image that we could copy to a SD card to hard reset the server on power cycle?

"Hey all,
So I've seen this happen on two separate R610s now in the last 2 days. We recently received 2 R610s back that was on loan to a vendor for the last 2 or so years. Before bringing it back into the pool, I plopped in a CD generated from Repository Manager that has the Linux Deployment Media on it in the first server. We've used this CD before on the other 20 R610s I support without issue. 
However upon rebooting, the BIOS which was supposed to be upgraded from version 2.2.10 to 6.3.0, has the BIOS Revision set to ""blank"". Yes. The POST screen says ""Bios Revision"" instead of ""Bios Revision 6.3.0"". After installing CentOS and attempting to re-run the Bios Update BIN file it says that the installed version is nothing.
Yeah. Not good. And because of this I can't access the System Services / USC / LifeCycle Controller. It just hangs there. 
Everything else updated fine (iDRAC, LifeCycle, drives, raid, network, etc). 

So I thought... try 2. Install OS first (CentOS) and run patches from root when install is finished. Same deal and same issue. Everything else patched fine except the BIOS. 

I have tried:
- Forcing a downgrade to 2.2.10 and 3.0.0 but both fail (even with the -f -q flags)
- Re-flashing it and the LifeCycle controller
- Attempted to run the Lifecycle repair package via the iDRAC interface (update the .usc file and have it run...)
The system itself is operable, but I have no idea what impact this could have long term.

"A technician removed an expansion card riser (the only one) from the dual-CPU PowerEdge R630 server in our remote data center. The server now runs with no risers installed and reports critical health alert ""HWC2005 System board Riser cable or interconnect failure. Check connection"". VMware ESXi hypervisor which is installed on this server runs normally (apparently).Owner's manual says: ""A System Event Log (SEL) event is logged if an expansion card riser is unsupported or missing. It does not prevent your system from turning on and no BIOS POST message or F1/F2 pause is displayed.""Troubleshooting guide says: ""Typically, the minimum to POST configuration for rack servers is PSU1, CPU1, memory module in A1 slot, and the default riser without expansion cards"". To the best of my knowledge, this was true until and including 11G PowerEdge rack servers. It also contradicts the statement in the Owner's manual.However, neither manual gives an explanation about the eventual consequences of running a PowerEdge R630 server with no expansion card risers installed.So my question is, will the R630 run normally without any expansion card riser installed, i.e. is such a configuration supported by Dell ?

"We have 3 (three) server Power Edge with warranty expired on 2015. We want to know if it'spossible reactivate the warranty or how much does it cost tech support forupgrade/diagnosis/functional control for all three servers



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
You would need to contact warranty sales to be certain. It is unlikely you would be able to renew the warranty. We typically only warrant servers for up to 5 years from the purchase date. There is the possibility to get warranties beyond 5 years, but 5 years is the normal maximum period. I doubt there are any 11th generation servers still in warranty.
You can still get fee-based support if you are out of warranty. Fee-based support is hardware troubleshooting only, and it is a per incident cost. Fee-based support may not be available in all regions, and the terms of the service may differ between regions. Fee-based support does not include parts replacement or onsite tech service, it is just hardware troubleshooting assistance.

"Fixed.... Sorry Dell messed with all my formatting lolSo I originally bought 5 identical R620's.I just replaced all the 8GB Dimm's in my production servers with 16GB DIMM's, so obviously I have a lot of spare of RAM.I went to install it in my 2 DR Servers.Loaded up the first one so it now has 24 x 8GB Dimm's.....Then I moved to the second..... to load it up with 12 more 8GB DIMM's.But I discovered I had added 4 x 16GB Dimm's to the original 12 x 8GB Dimm configuration (16 DIMM's total). Done so long ago I forgot lol.It's dell RAM, since I would have had them spec it out and my server guy on our account advise on the physical layout.(However I have to say the placement does seem odd..... but the memory layouts on servers now does give me a headache lol)1) Now first is a simple question and I'm 100% sure the answer is no since I have 2 CPU's but if someone can confirm.Trying to split this up and use 2 - 16GB dimm's in each server definitely won't work right?2) Second question is should I leave the 16's where the are and just pop in more 8's in the remaining 8 slots? Or do some or all of these 16GB's need to be moved?(Yes, I know mixing sizes isn't recommended but this is expensive RAM I'm not going to rip it out and stick it on a shelf. Plus it's worked this long.)Here is the current configuration (the other server is exactly the same except right now it has 24x 8GB DIMM's):Server - R620 (2 x Intel Xeon CPU E5-2630)Memory - 2RX4 PC3L - 1066R (Dual Rank)A1    8GB       B1    16GBA2    8GB       B2     8GBA3 16GB        B3    16GBA4    8GB       B4     8GBA5    8GB       B5     8GBA6    8GB       B6     8GBA7    8GB       B7     8GBA8    16GB     B8     8GBA9    Empty    B9     EmptyA10  Empty    B10  EmptyA11  Empty    B11  EmptyA12  Empty    B12  EmptyI'm assuming A8 and A1 should be reversed.I'm myself or my admin just messed up installing them but I don't want to move anything yet until I know.I do know the rule is keeping larger DIMM's closest to the CPU's channel wise right?Thanks in advance,Kenneth Morrissey



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
There is not a supported configuration to use all of the modules. The R620 does support the flexible memory configuration feature. The flexible memory configuration feature allows you to use unsupported memory configurations. Normally, if you did not populate the memory in a supported configuration the system would disable memory to attempt to create a supported configuration.
You shouldn't mix memory within a group, and the A and B lanes should be identical configurations. There are three memory groups spread across 4 channels on each lane. The groups are 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12. A supported configuration would be 16GB modules in 1,2 and 8GB modules in 5,6 and 9,10. The configuration would be the same on both A and B.

					Go to Solution.","Hello Mike
I wouldn't say it is recommended, but it will work. The only problem with mixing memory is that you will not be able to populate the third channel. It will make slots A3,A6 - B3,B6 unusable.

The rules to keep in mind would be to put the larger memory in the first slots
DIMMs must be installed in pairs at minimum unless booting to a single DIMM in A1 for testing
The two lanes must match

I would populate it something like this:
8GB - A1,A2,B1,B2
4GB - A4,A5,B4,B5
I can't think of a way off the top of my head to hit 40GB. If you are only running a single proc then you would populate it like this:
8GB - A1,A2
4GB - A4,A5
If there are any questions let me know.

"I'm having issues with Secure boot on a Power Edge T20 but only when running Windows Server 2016.
I'm trying to figure out if this is a BIOS issue or a hardware issue or if anyone else is experiencing it.
BIOS: A02-A12
Boot Type: UEFI with Secure Boot Enabled
OS: Windows Server 2016 Standard (verified ISO)
Basically what happens is the server will not reboot it only hangs before reboot. When it goes to reboot. It  sits at a black screen indefinitely. It does not get to the Dell BIOS Logo. It even gets as far as turning off USB devices like the keyboard. It will do a full shutdown though without issue. This actually happens even during OS install. The first reboot it during the install it hangs. If I turn off secure boot it works fine.
If I use Windows Server 2012 R2 with secure boot enabled it works fine as well.
I have tried it will all the published BIOS versions for the T20 and can reproduce it even on A12.

					Go to Solution.","Hello
Yes, if the controller supports offlining then it is best to offline the drive rather than just pulling it out. The rebuild should start automatically if you have a hot spare.
If you want to retain your slot assignments then you could unassign the hot spare, remove the hot spare, offline the predictive failure drive, physically remove the pred fail drive, and then insert the hot spare into that slot. A rebuild should initiate automatically, assign it as a hot spare if it doesn't. This would allow you to keep the drive/slot assignments the same as they currently are. The new drive can be put into the hot spare slot and assigned as hot spare. Our new controllers have the copyback feature to retain slot assignment.

"We have a PowerEdge 2950 that has had an Intrusion Alert for some time now. I have removed and re-inserted the cover many times trying to reset this sensor but it still reads as an intrusion alert. What scares me is that the fans are running at such high RPM's that I am afraid they are going to fail prematurely and not to mention it sounds like a jet engine in our server rack.
I had to replace the DVD ROM from the server about a month ago and I noticed the intrusion alert shortly after this has happened. I checked the DVD ROM and it appears to be seated in fine so I am at a loss of why this alert is happening. It does appear to me that the cover might not be pulling all the way in when I press the pull latch down, almost as something is wrong with the cover.
Is there an easy way to just disable the intrusion switch / alert or to throttle down the fans automatically? The temps in the case are fine, in fact it is very cool internally so the fans do not need to be working this hard.

Now just a side note, with the BIOS and iDrac let me know what version they are on, this is because if they're really far behind in updates then jumping to the most current can cause issues.

"Hi,Under normal circumstances it may be an obvious choice to recommend RAID 10 over RAID 1 if possible, but I’m after some advice/recommendations on which of the two options makes more sense on a H710P:1) 4 x 480GB SSD in RAID102) 2 x 960GB SSD in RAID1As I understand it (please let me know if I’m wrong), RAID10 has the benefit of increased read and write speeds, but does not offer an advantage in terms of resilience over RAID1? So my question is that, given the access speeds of SSD, does a RAID10 SSD array on a H710P significantly out perform a RAID 1 SSD array?This will be for a staging store for a ESXi server, where I’ll be reproducing firewall environments, if that helps any advice. Thanks,Dave

It will show up if you server is heavily utilized, unlikely users would know it."", but does not offer an advantage in terms of resilience over RAID1?""Raid 1 can only lose 1 drive no matter what . Raid 10 can lose 1 drive, a 50-50 chance of losing a second. In a 4 drive raid 10, you have 2 striped pairs. If one stripe loses both drives your OK. If  each striped pair loses a drive your toast. The more paired drives in a raid 10, the less chance of multiple drive failures causing a failed drive. I firmly believe in Murphy's law, I  do not count on losing more then 1 drive at a time.So, given the access speeds of SSD, does a RAID10 SSD array on a H710P significantly out perform a RAID 1 SSD array?It should. as most general servers read 80% and write 20%, you DB could be different but reads are prominent; reads being much faster  on a raid10. Also rebuilds, backups will be faster. Go with the raid 10, with a hotspare, and at least a spare you store away.

"We have a PowerEdge R420 running an VMware ESXi 5.1 server in RAID mode. We had a power outage that resulted in the R420 getting a ""SWC0700: iDRAC Not Ready"" error.  Our iDRAC setting version is 1.30.30.27.  I found the report about resetting the iDRAC and updating the iDRAC firmware with this version and error state.  Following the suggestions to unplug the power cables, USB cables and then holding the power button for 15 seconds did not clear up the problem.  The boots following this process had the same SWC0700 error.I created a OSMA7.1 boot DVD, and I tried to install, from a USB drive, various iDRAC versions newer that 1.30, but everytime the system reported /proc/ipmi/0/: file not found (or something similar as I'm going on my memory here).I needed the system up, so I pressed F1 to continue running.  The sytem seems to run fine except that the fans are running at high speed.I saw another post about holding the iDRAC button for 15 seconds to reset the iDRAC, and I tried this with the system up and running normally.  This didn't do anything to the fan speeds so I am assuming it had no effect on the iDRAC.I installed the Dell Administration COnsole VM on the ESXi hoping to run an iDRAC firmware upgrade from this VM, but, I couldn't connect to vCenter, which is probably beacuse I don't have a VCenter server, just two ESXi 5.1 servers -- I think I misread the DELL site thinking this might somehow work for me.Now, I'm thinking about running the bootable ISO I found on this webpage: www.dell.com/.../SLN296511My fear is that something might go wrong and I'll lose my server installation.Should I put my trust in the bootable updating ISO?  Should I call Dell support -- I'm about 4 months out of technician on-site repair warranty -- and plan to replace my motherboard as I've read in other posts on this forum?  Can the motherboard be replaced without corrupting my ESXi installation?I'm worried running the server with an ""iDRAC Not Ready"" error is going to burn out the server, or do something else that will ruin the server.  Should I even worry about this?Thanks for any advice and suggestions in advance.

There is not a process for removing a TPM, so there are no step-by-step instructions or a support article that I can provide on how to perform this action. The TPM is optional at time of purchase. The system can be purchased without a TPM or with several types of TPM.
The system should be able to operate without error after the TPM is removed if all TPM features are disabled. If any features requiring a TPM are enabled then there will be errors. Resetting defaults, clearing NVRAM, and draining flea power after removing the TPM should reset all settings to factory defaults. All TPM features should be disabled at factory defaults.
You can reference the system manual TPM section for warnings about removing TPM. For instance, the TPM module cannot be re-used once it has been removed from the system. There are also replacement instructions that should help you in removing the module.

After that then reseat the original riser the dimms were on.  The reason being is that will test the riser, dimm, and slots. If the error follows the dimms to the new slot and riser, then it lets us know the original riser and slots are good. So after all that then power the server up, then access Now with the dimms, can you verify that the part numbers match the dimms they are replacing. Lastly, would you verify that CSIOR ( Collect System Inventory on Restart ) is  enabled, you can enable/disable CSIOR through the iDRAC Configuration Utility by pressing <Ctrl><E> during boot up. Also, it could be helpful if you private message me the svc tag, so I know what is installed. Let me know what you see.

"Recently we purchased 3 Dell servers: DELL Power-edge R230 Xeon E3-1230 v6 4C 1x16GB H330 2x1TB SATA + 2x120GB SSD DVDROM 250W 3yr NBD + Rails from our local official Dell distributor, and we noticed that the spare disk's that came with servers, that we also ordered, were Toshiba DT01ACA regular sata HDD drive, and Western Digital SSD, with no indication what so ever that they were manufactured for Dell or by Dell. So my question is this common practice or serious breach of protocol. When we contacted local distributor, they replied, that this is normal thing, an those are Dell OEM parts.Furthermore that they came from Optiplex workstations, and Dell NB, and transferred by need, if the server need to be less expensive, or not specified exactly that you need server grade SSD and 10k, 15K, SAS disks. In addition those are entry level disks, and supported by R230 specification, as they mentioned. Their conclusion is that they have legitimate right to do that, and DELL is aware and condole this.

"T320 with Xeon E5-1410 will throttle and get stuck at low speed.  Cold rebooting server will fix.  Random issue occurred on 2 servers now.   One was set in the bios to DAPC.  The other, Windows controlled (yes Windows power settings were set to Performance).  One had the latest bios (Server 2012 R2) and the other had an older bios (Server 2008 R2).   I stress tested the cpu on both and observed no overheating.This is a known bug with Dell PowerEdge T320 Servers with a Intel Xeon E5-1410 v2.  On the Server 2012 R2 server, it was happening randomly only once or twice a month.  On the Server 2008 R2 server it only happened a couple of times at random.  The CPU would go down to below 0.20 Ghz and the 2012 server would crawl and service availability was seriously degraded.   This also happened to another client T320 Server with Server 2008 R2 with an Intel Xeon E5-1410.  Multiplier would not increase from 12 and the server was running at ~1.2ghz.  If your CPU has been tested and is not overheating, this is the workaround:  Resolution:  In the PowerEdge Bios, change the System Profile to Performance Optimized.  This will disable C-States and C1E.   Instructions:  www.ponjavic.com/.../disable-dell-poweredge-m620-cpu-throttling
This has to be a bug in the bios or the microcode of the CPU.  The above resolution works.My clients don't care about the minimal loss in power savings.  But all T320s ship with the default set to Performance Per Watt (DAPC).  This is a serious issue.

					Go to Solution.","We only validate drives running our firmware on the PERC H330. We do not block non-Dell drives, but we can't say with any certainty whether or not they will work.
The H330 supports drives larger than 2TB, so the drive size should not be a reason it is not functioning properly. This is most likely a firmware communication issue. If the drives are not being detected in the controller BIOS then I would try these things:

Make sure the drives is properly seated in the backplane or to the cable if it is a cabled configuration. I show you have an 8 drive backplane, so make sure the drives are properly inserted into the carrier. Also, make sure the carrier is properly inserted into the backplane. The latch should be in the open position when you insert the carrier, if the carriers are the latch style. If the drive is not properly inserted in the carrier or the carrier is not properly inserted into the backplane then the drive will not be connected to the backplane.
Try different firmware on the drive and controller. You may be able to find a firmware combination that allows the controller and drive to properly communicate.
Install an interposer. An interposer will change the way a SATA drive communicates. Anything that changes communication may allow the controller and drive to properly communicate. I'm not aware of any supported interposers on the T430, but any interposer should work.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
The ports should be labeled in several places. If you look at the ports on the back of the server they should have numbers on them. Port enumeration within the operating system may not match the physical port numbers. You can check the MAC address of the physical ports from within the iDRAC web interface. You can use the MAC address to verify the port enumeration within the OS.

"We would like to upgrade our server's memory but we are confused about the supported configurations.
Currently we have 24 GB in 6 slots (4 GB each in A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3 slots).  These memory modules are DDR3 1066MHz.  We would like to populate the remaining 6 slots with as much RAM as possible.
Questions:1) Do I need to purchase 1066MHz RAM, or can I buy 1333 or 1600?2) Can I buy 6 x 8 GB dual-ranked RDIMM modules and simply install them into slots A4, A5, A6, B4, B5, B6?3) If not, what would be the best configuration to get the maximum amount of RAM?
Thanks in advance!



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Additional memory information:
The DDR3 memory interface consists of three channels, with up to two RDIMMs or UDIMMs per channel for single/dual rank and up to two RDIMMs per channel for quad rank. The interface uses 2 GB, 4 GB, 8GB or 16 GB RDIMMs; only 1 GB or 2 GB UDIMMs are supported. The memory mode is dependent on how the memory is populated in the system:
Three channels per CPU populated identically Typically, the system will be set to run in Memory Optimized (Independent Channel) mode in this configuration. This mode offers the most DIMM population flexibility and system memory capacity, but offers the least number of RAS (reliability, availability, service) features. -All three channels must be populated identically. -The first two channels per CPU populated identically with the third channel unused  Typically, two channels operate in Advanced ECC (Lockstep) mode with each other by having the cache line split across both channels. This mode provides improved RAS features (SDDC support for x8-based memory). -For Memory Mirroring, two channels operate as mirrors of each other-writes go to both channels and reads alternate between the two channels.
-One channel per CPU populated This is a simple Memory Optimized mode. No mirroring or sparing is supported.
The R610 memory interface supports memory demand and patrol scrubbing, single-bit correction and multi-bit error detection. Correction of a x4 or x8 device failure is also possible with SDDC in the Advanced ECC mode. Additionally, correction of a x4 device failure is possible in the Memory Optimized mode.
-If DIMMs of different speeds are mixed, all channels will operate at the fastest common frequency. -RDIMMs and UDIMMs cannot be mixed. -If memory mirroring is enabled, identical DIMMs must be installed in the same slots across both channels. The third channel of each processor is unavailable for memory mirroring.
-The first DIMM slot in each channel is color-coded with white ejection tabs for ease of installation. -The DIMM sockets are placed 450 mils (11.43 mm) apart, center-to-center in order to provide enough space for sufficient airflow to cool stacked DIMMs. -The R610 supports up to 12 DIMMs. DIMMs must be installed in each channel starting with the DIMM slot farthest from the processor. Population order will be identified by the silkscreen designator and the System Information Label (SIL) located on the chassis cover. o Memory Optimized: {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} o Advanced ECC or Mirrored: {2, 3}, {5, 6} o Quad Rank or UDIMM: {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}
In the scenario's you have presented, each one will work in Optimized mode.  However, adding 1300mhz memory with a 1060 will result in all the memory running at 1060, the fastest common denominator.

The first module does not appear to be validated, so I can't say for sure it will work. From your statement it sounds like it is working without issue for you.
By just skimming the specifications I don't see a reason they cannot be used together. Your low voltage memory will operate at 1.5v when mixed with 1.5v memory, and they will negotiate down to the lowest common frequency.
You should avoid mixing memory within a memory grouping(1-4, 5-8, 9-12). The memory you have is similar enough that you can probably mix it, but it should be avoided if possible.

I am unhappy with the VGA only output of the embedded Matrox card.
Thanks for any suggestions



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","R430 supports twp type of expansion card risers, see here.
If you have a x16 riser, you should have 2 x16 slots available that can contain two 1/2 height 1/2 length cards. As such, any single slot card that will fit the carrier should work but i'd keep a GPU cards power levels low unless you find a Dell reference that confirms a 75w card is indeed supported in these slots.
Do note that if you have a UEFI based OS and secure boot is enabled, then you need UEFI capable graphics card firmware, graphics vendor keys in keystore?, etc?, etc?... And it may be that Dell has not done what's needed within UEFI firmware configuration for pcie graphics to even work... UEFI is outside my knowledge area...
But one problem you will find is that when you install a non dell certified card, fans will go nuts but at least Dell has provided IMPI commands to disable such an aggressive fan responce.
Below is comments pulled from post 6 which explains the issue and how to fix it on centos based systems.Similar is possible on Windows server OS though some components may need to be installed (links below).
Good luck,...
** Description: The default automatic cooling response on PowerEdge 13G server for third-party PCIe cards provisions airflow based on common industry card requirements. Our thermal algorithm targets delivery of maximum 55C inlet air to the PCIe card region based on that industry standard.
For some cards may not need additional cooling above the baseline (such as ones that have their own fan), Dell has enabled an OEM IPMI based command to disable this default fan response to the new PCIe card.
To remediate:
1. Install IPMI tools:
yum install OpenIPMI OpenIPMI-tools
chkconfig ipmi on  # << optional for the task
service ipmi start  # << optional for the task

2. Query Dell's Third-Party PCIe card based default system fan response:

"Hi,
I've R720 fully populated with 24x16 GB dual-rank RDIMMs = they have 384 GB total.
I'd like to upgrade them to 512 GB, but apparently if quad-rank DIMM is installed, the last bank in channel has to remain empty.
Is that correct?If yes, is it possible to have one channel per CPU populated with 2x32 GB DIMMs and all remaining channels populated with 16 GB ones?Or all 4 channel need to have exactly the same DIMM layout?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","One more question - it seems that following the rules, the only way to increase total memory for host fully populated 24x16 GB is to remove ALL 16 GB DIMMs and replace with 16x32 GB ones?
Yes, that sounds correct. You would need to swap out all memory with 32GB modules to increase the total memory since you are losing access to 4 slots due to quad rank memory.

"Greetings, first post and a newbie at servers.  I'm refurbing a Dell PowerEdge R710 (Gen11) server.
It's either a 5503 or 5504 (Have found specs that point to both #'s) (2Ghz)
It has PERC6/I and PERC6/E (Powervault MD1000).
All firmware and drivers are up to date.
I had to install new batteries for both PERC's.  There was the initial charging period and then they both show up charged and fine in OpenManage.
Since I'm refurbing, I power down at night. When I boot the next morning the batteries say charging. They charge for a bit then show OK.
This happens every night since 11/26.
It this normal and does the server have to run all the time or is this an issue with the (less expensive) ebay batteries?  Shouldn't a charged battery hold a charge overnight?
Does it on both PERCS.
Any feedback or suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks!



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
The system is designed to be constantly powered. It is normal for the batteries to drain when the system is not powered. The batteries are in good condition if they are able to maintain a 24 hour charge. Once they can no longer hold a 24 hour charge they should report as failed.
If you let the batteries drain below a certain threshold they will disable write cache until they cross that charge threshold. Any time the controller is charging the battery and not just maintaining the charge it is normal for it to report as charging.

If you encounter issues after moving a server then you should start by checking for anything that may have come loose. I would press on the memory and all cabling to make sure everything is still firmly seated. If nothing changes then you should re-seat everything. I would avoid re-seating the CPUs until all other steps had been attempted. It is very unlikely the CPUs would come loose.
If the issue persists after all of the above steps then you should take the system to minimum-to-POST to attempt to narrow down the fault. Here is an article on troubleshooting a no-POST issue:

Re-licensing may be needed. You will need to supply the license key, which should be imported after system board replacement.
iDRAC reconfiguration may be needed. You will supply the configuration file, which should be imported after system board replacement.

Once those steps are done then I would verify that the server is up to date on updates as well.

With a single processor installed you would have to add the 3x 16GB dimms to slot A1, A2, and A3. Then place the 8GB dimms in slots A4, A5, and A6. 
That will ensure that the channels match and will allow you to use all the dimms. 
In regards to the speeds, it will depend on the dimms installed and their configuration.

For single- or dual-rank memory modules:

One memory module per channel supports up to 1333 MHz.
Two memory modules per channel supports up to 1066 MHz. (Per BIOS revision on May 15, 2009, support was added for two modules per channel at 1333 MHz speed.)
Three memory modules per channel are limited to 800 MHz regardless of the memory module speed.


For quad-rank memory modules:

One memory module per channel supports up to 1066 Mhz.
Two memory modules per channel are limited to 800 MHz, regardless of memory module speed.

Higher tier servers generally offer more configuration options. Also, the base feature set may be different. You can configure the servers to be nearly identical, but the T430 should have a higher maximum possible configuration.

"This one has me a little stumped. I received my Dell Poweredge 2850 today and while it works fine, the LCD on the front does not work. It originally came with the original firmwares and such. I've updated the BIOS to A07 and the BCM firmware to 1.83. I've also tried to reseat the connections to the LCD to no luck. The backlight seems fine but no text is displaying. I've tried cycling from none to default and then inputting custom strings in the BIOS but it still won't display anything. What else can I try to see if I can get the LCD working? I've included a video of what it's doing as well. 

If it makes any difference, the server doesn't have IPMI or DRAC4 cards installed.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Ksantillan06,

Neither of your suggested configurations will work. A couple reasons why, first is that when 2 processors are installed the dimms must be identical to both processors. Second is that each side has 3 channels, as seen bellow, and they will need to match as well. 

So what I would suggest is to place the 16gb dimms in the white tabbed slots and the 8gb in the black. If the dimms are compatible then that should allow the configuration. 
Let me know how it goes.

CPU is behaving like C states were not turned off. It jumps from 0.17Ghz to 2.20Ghz depending on system load.
Throttling the CPU is not a C state. C states are idle states. If the CPU frequency is above 0 it is not a C state.
The ACPI driver within the operating system controls P states. The maximum CPU frequency may be throttled by the system board in certain situations. If 2.2 GHz is the maximum rated frequency of the CPU then this issue is software related. If the maximum frequency of the CPU is higher than 2.2 GHz but the OS is showing it is limited to 2.2 then then system board is throttling it for some reason, most likely due to inadequate power or a CMC or iDRAC not working properly.

You will likely need to change out all of the cabling, and you should check to see if your bezel will accommodate two more slots. Sometimes we install a blank to cover slots, which can be removed, and sometimes it requires a different bezel.
Since this is not supported it will be trial and error. You can order the parts you think will be needed and if you encounter issue you may need to order additional parts.

"I have a 2 node (Dell R720's) cluster that was just rebuilt from 2012 to 2012 R2. It's linked to a Dell MD3200 array for the CSV.
I knew multi-pathing had to be installing to see the array properly as one drive but wasn't certain how it should be done. I installed the MPIO feature in Server Manager but I knew that there was software missing that had been there on the nodes when they ran 2012.
I figured out that it was the Dell MDSM so I installed that. Now when running the cluster validation I get errors about a DSM mismatch between nodes. It shows the Microsoft and Dell DSM's installed on both nodes which I now figure is the MPIO and the MDSM. the versions of each manufacturer's DSM do agree between the 2 nodes but of course they don't match each other.
I'm assuming I am not supposed to run both DSM's and need to uninstall one of them. Since the array is a Dell and I'm sure I remember the software being there before I wonder if I should uninstall the MPIO feature via Server Manager. If I do, will this mess up anything? I'd rather try and live with the version mismatch errors than mess up the array or cluster in any way.

I'm not aware of a setting that would disable the logo screen, but you can use the NVRAM clear jumper to reset the BIOS to defaults.

That said, if you are using clustering or some other technology that monitors your server OS by IP, you would be better serviced by using a unique IP for the LCC.  This way those other technologies will not see the LCC (when active) and think that it is really seeing your OS (which would be inactive at that moment).
Also, if your server has a separate NIC available for the iDrac, I would recommend using it instead of sharing one of the LOMs.

"Hello all,
Thanks in advance for helping out a complete newbie to server architecture. I'm an experienced custom desktop PC builder for almost two decades, but I recently purchased a used R510 and have realized I have much to learn! This server is being used in my home, not a business setting.
Objectives: 

Setup remote management, as this system will be headless once installed in a rack
Install FreeNAS on mirrored 2.5"" HDD's in the internal drive caddy
Use all 12 front 3.5"" drive bays for 8TB WD Reds, this will be my FreeNAS array

Background:
Here's an ongoing thread I have over at the FreeNAS forums, in case it is useful for reference, or anyone is trying to emulate what I'm attempting and find it useful reading.
Here's a link to my Dell Service Tag so you can see how the server was configured from Dell. 
The server currently is setup in a RAID configuration using the H700 with 10 drives combined into a single virtual drive. That drive has Windows Server 2016 Standard installed and activated on it. There's also an iDrac Enterprise card installed. 
Questions:

My goal is to place this server in a rack, but still want to keep an eye on thermals, power consumption, software updates and so forth over my home network. Once configured, I want to make the system completely headless.The system already has iDrac Enterprise card installed, but no vFlash SD card. I'd like to make a backup of the server's current system configuration before I make any changes to it. There are 10 Dell SAS HDD's (lower capacity than the WD Red's I want to use for FreeNAS) currently installed with the RAID config for Windows Server 2016.

Is there any easy way to export this current hardware configuration via USB thumb drive before I remove all the Dell drives and swap them out with the WD Reds? I tried exporting the server configuration, but it gave me an error message about needing a licensed Dell vFlash card. I had just a standard SD card in the slot, but the only other option that seemed to be available was export to CDROM, of which there was none attached to the system. How does one select USB thumb drives as an export destination for server configuration files? I'd like to save a copy of the current RAID config, plus Windows Server installation information in case I ever wanted to repurpose the server away from FreeNAS and swap out drives to go back to its original Windows Server 2016 configuration. 



How do I setup the iDrac management to use OMSA?
Once FreeNAS (based upon FreeBSD) is installed, I won't have any Windows environment to install Windows-based utilities. Based on my reading (someone correct me if I'm wrong!) OMSA needs to be installed on both the management station (my primary Windows 10 desktop) and on the R510 too, inside of Windows.
Can one take full advantage of the remote management features without having an operating system installed? If so, how does one start to configure this?
I've read that iDrac Enterprise works in a pre-OS environment, which is exactly how I'd want to access it once FreeNAS is installed. What needs to be installed/configured on the R510 to make this happen? What needs to be installed/configured on my Windows 10 desktop to access it once configured, or can everything on the management desktop be done over a web-browser? 
Those are my main concerns right now, and if anyone can point a complete server beginner in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it. I realize I have much to learn. Thank you for your assistance!

					Go to Solution.","Hi,
You are going to want to configure the iDRAC through ctrl+E during post to give it an IP address. A static address is recommended so that it doesn’t change. Once this is done you can use a web browser on your Windows 10 machine to access that IP address and you can access a web gui that allows you to monitor and do remote access through the browser. This will work outside the OS or with no OS installed, you just need a monitor for the initial configuration of the IP address.
 
There is not an OMSA version for FreeBSD/FreeNAS.  
 
There is not any need to export the configuration prior to replacing the drives since you will creating a new configuration.
 
FreeNAS may not work properly with an H700.

I'm unaware of a white paper that explains the cache options. The options are explained in the OMSA storage manual, page 48. The second storage manual on the page is the correct link. I have already reported that the installation guide is mislabeled as the storage manual:
www.dell.com/support/home/product-support/product/dell-openmanage-server-administrator-9.0.1/manuals
Why is the SAS cache disabled? I thought it would make the disk faster to Enable it.
Yes, enabling the disk cache should increase performance, but it is not battery backed. If there is a sudden loss of power or a hardware failure in the RAID chain there is an increased chance of data loss/corruption if the disk cache is enabled.
I don't know the reason why we enable SATA cache by default, but I suspect it is likely due to complaints about performance on SATA drives. The performance difference is not usually as noticeable on SAS drives.

"After working nights and nights on this I have came to the conclusion that the nvidia's apparently have problems with black screening after windows logo.  This is very frustrating but I would really like some help.  I want to get the Pci Express x1 NVS 300 video card to work in my T100 with Windows 7 x64 installed.  I installed the supplied driver and after restart it goes black after windows booting logo. I reboot into safemode and the video is working. I installed the latest NVidia drivers released in Feb 2012. I restart and it goes black. I go back into safemode and made sure windows aero features where off (they already were). I try a bunch more older version from Nvidia and it goes black. I switched a few irq's around in the bios and it goes black. I have no idea what these drivers are doing that causes a black screen but I can not figure it out. I have searched google a ton and a lot of things I tried came from reading other forum posts so I am hoping a Dell guy/gal will step in on this forum.  I have tried it with the vga adapter on my dell lcd monitor and the dvi adapter on my dell lcd monitor. I actually have two slightly different dell lcd monitors and both them have the same issue. I have the card in my pcix 1 slot and that is the only card installed on the motherboard. I have also tried the card in the x4 slot and it comes up but Windows marks it as having a hardware issue and disables the driver.  I just updated my bios to the newest one suggest on my Dell T100 support page which is PET100-010401C and that did not fix anything.
Can someone help me?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","As you know, the BIOS on your PE T100 does not allow your to disable the integrated ATI ES1000 video controller which means you will run into all sorts of issues. And no doubt you have seen the many posts on such topics with the many hit/miss outcomes. 
In another posts you asked about removing the management card (which in some systems is a pci card laid flat on the motherboard and contains the ES1000 graphics amongst other functions). But there is no mention of such a card on the T100 hardware owners manual so it doesn't seem to have one to remove.
And the odd thing in the HOM is that on page 106 we see,
""Trouble Shooting Video Subsystem,Action 2. Determine whether the system has an expansion card with a video output connector. In this system configuration, the monitor cable should normally be connected to the connector on the expansion card, not the system's integrated video connector. To verify that the monitor is connected to the correct video connector, turn off the system and wait for 1 minute, then connect the monitor to the other video connector and turn the system on again"".
Hardly a statement that clarifies much! I would expect that if the BIOS actually does not allow one to disable the integrated video, then there should be a clear statement that video expansion cards are not supported and that the system's integrated video connector should always be used. 
My only suggestion is to try the NVS300 in the x8 PCIe slot and if that fails, try a cheap ATI based x16 PCIe consumer card of similar vintage to the ES1000 (but this would require cutting a slot on the card's connector to allow it to fit into the x8 slot). Again this may still have conflicts and fail to work so it's a suck it and see approach. A second hand ATI x16 PCIe card can be had for very little outlay (but always test it works in a desktop PC before your start to hack away).

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Phykell,
The answer would be based on the amount of processors installed. In populating the server the guidelines you need to adhere to, and make sure the new dimms aren't violating is; 1) you can't mix Rdimms and Udimms, so ensure that they are the same. 2) is that when populating you must make sure the channels match. 3) The larger dimms must be 1st in the channels. So hypothetically if you were to have 2 processors, 24 dimms (8 16GB and 16 8GB). You can place the 16GB dimms in the slots with the white tabs and then the 8GB in the green and black lots. Giving you 256GB, I am not certain the amount of memory you wish to go to, so I am just giving examples. You could also do a smaller configuration of 8 16GB in the white tabs and 8 8GB dimms in the black slots. 
You can find additional guidelines and suggestions on page 40-46 of this manual - http://bit.ly/1oCytUF

"I have an iDRAC 6 card in my Dell PowerEdge R710. While I can access the web-based interface, it seems rather slow (though this isn't really my top concern). My major concern is that shortly before or after the BIOS finally turns control over to the OS the front LCD display freezes and no longer can be interacted with through the 3 buttons on the front of the server until the system is completely powered down. Then, when powering on again the same issue occurs at right around the same time.

					Go to Solution.","Hello
I would disconnect the control panel to see if the iDRAC performance changes. If the iDRAC performance changes then the issue is likely with the control panel or a cable.
Make sure all power is disconnected from the system when disconnecting the control panel and avoid ESD damage to any components. The two cables you will want to disconnect is the control panel ribbon cable and the USB cable. You can leave the SD module cable connected. You will need to use the iDRAC to power the system on while the control panel is disconnected.
If the iDRAC performance changes with the control panel disconnected then reseat all cables to make sure they are properly seated. If the issue returns then you can test with the USB or SD module disconnected and only the control panel connected. You can mix and match connections to try to narrow down what is causing the issue.

There was an issue with that firmware version. We pulled it from the download site. 25.3.0.0016 is the version that is currently available.
25.4.0.0011 will not likely be released. A newer version that corrects the issues will be released in its place. If you do not want to wait for the new FW release or a new OMSA release to get rid of the update notification then you can edit the version file. In your OMSA installation directory there is a file called lsiver.cfg. The current version information is stored in that file. The default installation directory should be something like:
c:/program files/dell/sysmgt/sm/cfg
The file should be located in that directory. If you open the file with notepad and search for H330 you should be able to locate the H330 current firmware version information. There are multiple H330 controllers. If you are unsure which controller you are using then you can modify all of them to 25.3.0.0016 or you can just modify the controller you are using.

"Is the Xeon X3320 (Yorkfield, 6M Cache, 2.50 GHz, 1333 MHz FSB, LGA775, 95W) supported by the PET100? I want to upgrade the CPU and my options ($) are the E3110 or the X3320.

The E3110 ( part DW472  for the processor alone or part P694D for the service kit) is the only processor you had listed that is currently showing as supported in the T100. None of the C2 Duos are showing, nor is the X3320, there is an X3220 and an X3330 though.

"We did something that has apparently turned off the front panel LCD display and Power light - The server is up and running normally, just no lights in the front (except for the blinking HHDs).  And pressing any of the 3 panel buttons -- left arrow, select, or right arrow does not do anything.
I have been trying to search the web, but can't quite get the right search string to help me find the answer...but I did encounter this bit that seems to make sense, unfortunately it doesn't say how to turn it back on.
...the LCD backlight will remain off if the LCD messaging is turned off; this can be done via the web-based graphical interface, IPMITOOL, Open Mange System Administrator, or a command line too such as RACADM.

The LCD is part of the Control panel as shown below:
 

Before removing the control panel:

If installed, remove the front bezel.
Remove the backplane if on the way of the control panel by first disengaging the hard drives
Turn off the system and attached peripherals.
Disconnect the system from the electrical outlet and peripherals.
Open the system cover.

 
Using a #2 Phillips screwdriver, remove the screw(s) securing the control panel to the chassis

 
From inside the system, push the front panel out of the chassis.

 
Reseat all the cables connecting the control panel to the system board and replace the control panel.

Yes, you will need to make sure the iDRAC and system BIOS are up-to-date to support the 5600 series CPUs. Your system will support 5600 series CPUs that are less than 130w.

"Hi,
We have the latest firmware available applied to our iDrac7, however our security team have been doing scans and found CVE-2013-4786, CVE-2013-4037 vulnerabilities against the latest firmware.  Are there any plans to address these CVE's in a future update?
Many thanks
Martin



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
I'm not aware of any plans to address those vulnerabilities. A feature of the iDRAC is IPMI. Those are IPMI vulnerabilities. IPMI is not something we designed, it is an industry standard specification. If a newer version of IPMI that is more secure is released we will likely use it.
If you are not using IPMI over LAN then you should be able to disable that feature on the iDRAC. That will stop the use of IPMI over the network. IPMI can still be used from within the host operating system with that option disabled. That should stop it from being flagged as a network vulnerability.

"I am re-doing a R710 with fresh software. I intend to run HyperV with 2 VM's. I made drive C on the physical 120GB so it won't run out of space as Microsoft OS's do. I installed WS 2016 standard.
I am used to the apparently old version of OpenManage. It appears now there are two possibilities, OpenManage for Managed Node   or  OpenManage Essentials. I just want the hardware diagnostic features that older versions had and did not eat up a lot of disk space. Now I see ""Essentials"" requires over a GB and requires a bunch of software such as ASP.net, IIS, C++ runtime, etc. I don't want to fill up disk, just essential hardware diags on a stand-alone server. Further, now Openmanage Node has some cryptic popup messages about requiring a ""HTTPS listener"", is that IIS? When I select install listerner an an unreadable error message flashes.

OpenManage Server Administrator (Managed Node) should be what you are looking for. I don't think it has built in diagnostics though.

The R410 has a very odd memory configuration. It is tri-channel and dual bank, but the second bank is only a single DIMM slot. With mismatched banks it makes everything confusing.

Yes, each processor or CPU should have identical or mirrored memory. Hence, the memory on the populated channels have to be identical for optimal memory configuration.

"Hi,
We sometimes get an alert from OME to tell us something is wrong with a server, but we don't know what. When we check, we find that the DRAC System Event Log File is full.
I see there is a racadm command to clear the log - clrsel
But, is there a way to tell when it is 90% full or around that level? (even a racadm command that can be run to check whether it is ~90%)?
(We have a mixture of m610, m620, R515, R820, R730xd, and m1000e's)

"Hello!
How do you people do hw-monitoring of the M100e chassis?
A blade can be checked via IPMI from the iDRAC. Or via the openmanage package, but i would prefer to be platform-agnostic here.
I cant see that any of the sensors from the drac-ipmi-system references any PSUs or similar.
The PSUs are in the chassis. So how are we supposed to monitor that? :)
I have looked and looked for any ""enable IPMI"" in the CMC of the chassis, but cant find it.
Any suggestions?
  wbr / Alex




					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","I actually found a nice command to use in the CMC. Its quite easy to automatize this.
On your surveillanve-server, create a ssh key-pair.
Then upload the public key in the CMC like this
$ pkey=`cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | tr -d '\n'`       # gives the variable 'pkey' the contents of the public key
$ ssh root@CHASSIS ""racadm sshpkauth -i svcacct -k 1 -p 0xfff -t '$pkey'""    # will ask you for the CMC root pwd (calvin by default)
The thing is, i didnt see how to set a ssh key for the root account, so you set the key for an account called ""service"".
Then you should be able to login to the CMC as user service, like this
$ ssh service@CHASSIS    # make sure you use the ssh key now
And FINALLY, you can run the command ""getactiveerrors""

$ getactiveerrorsThere are no messages.

SO, this is easy to script, for instance to use with nagios/nrpe, like this (you can also specify in .ssh/config that you want to use the user 'service' when you connect to that host)

#!/usr/bin/env bash
chassis_name=$1
if [ -z ""$chassis_name"" ]then    echo ""Usage: $0 <chassis-name>""    exit 2fi
out=`ssh service@$chassis_name getactiveerrors | tr '\n' ',' | tr -s ' -'`r=$?
if ((r))then    echo ""Failed to ssh to $chassis_name.""    exit 2fi
if [ ""${out:0:22}"" == ""There are no messages."" ]then    echo ""Chassis $chassis_name all OK.""    exit 0else    echo $out    exit 2fi

"Hello, we bought Dell PowerEdge T20 for our organization without HDDs. We bought two hard drives Western Digital Black 2 TB 3,5"" (WD2003FZEX-00SRLA0) separately and installed them.
After that I created mirror raid via software RAID tool (CTRL+I on boot), installed Windows 10 Pro and everything seems to be OK. But after installation of the OS I dettached one of the drives, start the OS and shut down. Then I attached the 2nd HDD and the system started rebuild. In 1-2 hours I noticed that the HDD lamp stop blinking (the rebuild was finish) restart the PC and noticed missing 2nd HDD. The same scenario happens 2-3 times later. Only when I shut down system and power on again the BIOS recognize the second HDD.
I'm wondering what occurs this? Bad SATA cable or incompatible disk drive?

"Hi,
I'm running into an issue on the PE R620 and hopefully someone can provide an answer here. 
I installed Windows 2012 R2 on R620 and when I was doing the Windows Update I noticed that it is really slow. After looking at the throughput, I noticed that the it is downloading at 20 kbps and that did not make any sense. So I unplugged the Ethernet cable from NIC1 and connected to NIC2. Of course, the download process started at normal speed. 
I then plugged the Ethernet cable back to NIC1 and visit Dell website to download a firmware and I noticed that it was behaving the same. 
Next, I decided to update both the Windows driver and the board firmware to the latest version (available on Dell). The update was successful but that did not resolve the issue. Also, Bios, Lifecycle controller and RAID controller were all updated to the latest version.
I then run Dell pre-boot system assessment and every single test passed. With that, I decided to order a new Intel I350. Got the board today, installed it and it is behaving the same. I re-installed the OS.. still the same thing. 
Also, I came across few posts that talked about disabling ""Large Send Offload V2"" which I did, and rebooted the server. That did not help. 
And finally, I took a different approach and booted the server using Ubuntu Live CD. and it worked OK... I managed to download files at 5 mbps. 
So what can cause this? Why throughput on NIC1 does not exceed 20 kbps? 
Thanks. 



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","I guess network admin can sometime limit the throughput on the network side... :) 
An entry was made awhile back on the firewall to limit the download/upload limit for an IP that was being assigned to the server by the DHCP server... And that it why my download speed was so slow.

Those messages relate to the lifecycle controller. Whatever you are trying to run may not be fully compatible with a T110. The T110 is a limited feature set server. It has a baseboard management controller. It does not have an iDRAC or lifecycle controller.
What can i do to make sure it's all updated and functional?
I would suggest that you go ahead and install an operating system. It is much easier to perform updates from an operating system. If you install a compatible Windows operating system then you can use the Server Update Utility from within Windows to perform updates.

I would suggest that you update to the next supported release for the R720 once it is available.

I'm not sure if 2.43 was tested against any systems not on the support list.
There is a disclaimer on the 2.43 download page that states do not backflash, so I would wait until 2.5 comes out for the R720 to update. If you encounter any iDRAC related issues running 2.43 then I would contact warranty support for help on how to proceed.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","2.) I tried looking all over the internet trying to figure out why channel 0 is better to put the larger?
It seemed to make sense to me to put the 2 x 4GB into channel zero, as that would bring to total RAM to chan 0 = 8GB, and then if I put 8GB in the others slots, that would make all ""Channels"" equal in size, or am I missing something?

I mixed up the guidelines with another familiar server. Refer to the diagram below:

The memory configuration of the R410 server is rather different from the rest. Processor 1 has 2 memory banks consisting of slots A1, A2 & A3 and the other bank is just slot A4. On the other hand, Processor 2 also has 2 memory banks consisting of slots B1, B2 & B3 and the other bank is just slot B4. For optimal memory configuration, memory in each of the banks has to be the same. We do not mix the memory sizes on these banks. Accordingly, you would have as observed Slots A1, A2 &A3 and B1, B2 &B3 = 4 GB and A4 &B4 =8 GB. In this case not necessarily ""Channels"" equal in size but banks equal in size. You are not missing a thing here! For more information,see pages 119 - 123 of the Users' Guide: ftp.dell.com/.../poweredge-r410_owner's manual_en-us.pdf

3.) I figured out that if I put, 4GB modules into slots 1,2,3 and 8GB into slot 4, and then reverse for the other server. I do NOT get the ""unoptimized configuration"" messages on boot. That also means I have one server with 40GB of RAM and another with 56GB of RAM which is very nonoptimal for my needs. 
What to do????

Unfortunately, you can't achieve 48 GB of optimal memory configuration with your current memory. For optimal 48 GB of memory you will need 6x 8 GB modules populated on slots A1, A2 &A3 and B1, B2 &B3 leaving slots A4 &B4 empty or unused.

"Hello.We have a T310 which we are not able to completely upgrade right now, so we thought we should do it in steps.I understand that officially the T310 only supports PERC 6/i, H300, H700, but those don't work very well with SSDs.Would it work with the H730 controller? I understand it might not show up, or show up as an error in dell administration software, but will I able to make a raid volume, and then boot from it?Current Hardware:Dell PowerEdge T310Intel Xeon X3440I did not found any information about using non-supported raid controllers.

					Go to Solution.","However, there are a lot of talks about how the H700 is completely unusable with SSDs. Getting less than 1/10th of a single SSD's speed in RAID. I'd be better off using punched cards.
I know you were being funny, but that is SO untrue. Even 1/10 of SSD real-world capability would rival an average SATA disk's real-world performance. YES, it is a waste of money, but it hardly sets you back to the era of punch cards.Worst-case, it sets you back to your pre-SSD upgrade.
Not sure what you are reading or by whom, but 1/10 of their potential can't be accurate without some serious implementation errors. I have upgraded a good part of my older servers, but I do have an older server with an H700 running QB on an SSD RAID 1 with Intel  that tested with 2-3 times (I'd have to run again to be sure, but it was significantly higher) the read/write scores as my RAID 10 with 4x300/15K SAS drives in the same server. That is after being in service for 6 years.
Thing to remember is that you can't just through in a bunch of EVO or Kingston SSD's in your server. Go with the pro line of Intel or Samsung - they usually work fine. Search the forums for help knowing which ones people have had problems or success with.

"Hello,
We are trying to re-purpose a ex GSA PowerEdge R720xd server.
After spending some time trying to get access to the BIOS and finding several posts which said it was impossible on a GSA server we opted to replace the system board with a standard PowerEdge R720xd.
This appears to have gone well, the system boots, the RAM and both processors are detected, but then the below is displayed.

""PCIe Training Error: Integrated RAID""
""System Halted!""

Can't get into any BIOS, Lifecycle Management as this message is always displayed.
We have tried re-seating the RAID card and the little LED on the card lights up, but this message is still displayed.
Have I missed something? Is it because there may still be a RAID config on the card? Is there a way to clear this without being able to get into RAID setup?
Thanks,



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","No, it's not because of any configuration on the card, but it's possible they were using a proprietary card or a card with proprietary firmware on the old board with its custom firmware. Remove the RAID card from the storage slot. The storage slot can only accept validated cards. You might be able to use it in one of the generic slots or you might need to force-flash the existing card or get a supported one.

"So I purchased a used H700 so I could utilize a couple 5tb sata drives I had laying around.  I know using non enterprise drives is not the best idea especially in my current raid 0 config.  
All that aside:  I have 2 toshiba PH3500U-1I72 drives in that raid 0 config.  I want to purchase a third but found a ""updated"" version X300 HDWE150XZSTA about $80 cheaper than the ones I already have in the raid 0 array.  The reason I want another drive is to wipe the raid 0 and go to raid 5 for a little bit of a safety net for my NON enterprise drives that I know are not rated for servers.  Is this worth trying since they are so similar to save a few bucks or will the firmware and other differences not allow me to proceed?  
This is not a production server only storage for media and used to study for certs and mess around with labs.  I have qty 4 500gb SAS Dell drives in the same server that I have to reconfigure since I loose a drive once I purchase another.

"We recently purchased an R900. I tried to use 2 western digital black 1TB hard drives set up in a RAID1
The array was successfully created and was seen as Optimal. But after a short period of time I get a an HDD fault on that array (both drives blinking amber). I bought  a new WD Black 1TB drive thinking that I might have a bad drive. I attempted to create a new array with the new drive and got the same error but again the RAID controller saw no problem with the array(but still two blinking amber lights). I was beginning to think that my PERC 6i card might be bad. As a test I wiped one of my new WD 1TB Black drives inserted jut that drive in the box and booted up. It was green for the first minute or so after boot and then it began blinking amber with a HDD error again. I tried the other 3 of my WD 1TB drives one by one with the same result. Lastly I found an older 120GB WD drive and tried that drive. This time there was no HDD Error message and the light has remained green. I doubt that I have 4 bad WD 1TB Black Drives. My guess is that the r900 has a drive capacity limit and that a 1TB Drive is too large. Can anyone confirm this and tell my what the drive size limit is for the R900 using 2.5 drives?

					Go to Solution.","All anecdotal. I'm glad they work for you, but inconsistency is the key and the primary reason why you wouldn't want to use them in a server. They are not designed for servers, for RAID, or for high-performance enterprise data applications. 2TB is the hard limit on the PERC 6 for physical disks, but every unsupported drive you put in there will be a completely different experiment, and you are bound to see different results with different makes, models, sizes, cache, speed, geometry, programming/firmware, etc.

					Go to Solution.","I agree with Todd and would add that another level of test is to run each power supply independently. This eliminates the slight potential for one power supply to be just out of tolerance (ratio-wise) with the other. That isn't commonly a problem in dual power supply chassis, but it is a frequent problem in the tri and quad power supply systems (higher likelihood of inconsistent tolerances across all power supplies).

It sounds like the issue may be that the SD card currently has a Hypervisor installed on it, and is interfering with the new OS installation, but lets verify if it is OMSA causing.

Not so sure why this is associated with the same date code. Try to initiate a battery learn cycle during which time the charge on the battery will completely be drained and then recharged. Use this command: omconfig storage battery action=startlearn controller=id battery=id , where id is the controller ID and battery ID as reported by the omreport command.

You still need this battery. In the 512 non-volatile cache option, the battery enables the transfer of data from this cache to the system flash memory for data retention for a couple of years in event of sudden power outage.

This may be a dumb question, but how is the Heat sink normally attached to the back board? is it soldered on or held on by a screw(s)?

It is held in by two pins/screws. You can see the two holes used to anchor the heat sink in the image. One of the pins/screws is missing, so the heat sink is not attached in this image. The heat sink coming detached may be the cause of the problem or it may have become detached because of the overheating.
We are basically seeking any advice/recommendations anyone may know as to how this may have happened (i.e. electrical surge, bad install/improper build, too hot environment, degraded UPS backup battery, etc.)
Root cause analysis is not something that can typically be done outside of a lab. We do fault isolation troubleshooting. There are many possible causes. An external or internal electrical issue with almost any hardware could cause damage throughout the system. I would suggest monitoring, testing, and running diagnostics on hardware throughout the system and any electrical devices attached to the system(UPS, Surge protector).

Stupidly, a former colleague setup a CRM system on what was meant to be an old development server that had long since been retired from frontline service but somehow between him and one of our developers, this became a ""live"" server with real data being added to a virtual machine (it's running a VSphere hypervisor) . Sure enough the PowerEdge 2970 in question has just died (all sorts of voltage regulator error codes for the CPU 1 side of things) and as you can probably guess, no backups since he created this a year ago.
I had a look at it today and tried a couple of the suggestions I found on here associated with the error codes but without any luck, so I guess it's probably the mainboard itself.
We do have a couple of other retired but still working (at least, still booting) 2970's in the server room that I might be able to cannibalise to get this one running again for long enough to copy the virtual machine off. However, they're not exactly the same spec. Processor wise and memory wise they're a match but the problem machine has a PERC6i controller with six disks (and I've no idea what the current configuration of those disks are other than a note I found that indicates 2 disks are used for the hypervisor and the other 4 disks are used for the virtual machines) and the other 2 PE2970's have a PERC5 and no disks at all.
I'm pretty sure just simply moving the disks across would be a bad idea and possibly risk the data on them. Do you think swapping the PERC6i and the disks across to one of these spares would work? Would the PERC6 retain the disk configuration as setup on the original server when powered up in the ""new"" server?
Alternatively, there's the option of swapping the mainboard across from one of the working servers, though I'm not sure if there will be any BIOS issues with it suddenly finding a different PERC controller attached to it.
Any suggestions or pointers would be appreciated? As you can probably tell, I'm far from an engineer or server admin for that matter. Just need to get the thing up and running for long enough to clone the virtual machine onto something a little more suitable (and warrantied).
Thanks in advance.

					Go to Solution.","Yes, moving the PERC 6 over is fine and will retain the RAID config. You should not be considering moving the PERC 6 VD to a PERC 5.
Because the PERC 5 and 6 are both supported on the 2970, the fact that some have PERC 5's probably also means their firmware is older. I would strongly recommend updating the BIOS/ESM/BMC on the target 2970 so that the PERC 6 is supported.

"Morning all.

Dell PowerEdge 710 that came off warranty in Jan 2016. It was in production for years without issue.

We removed from stock today to test before recycling. No matter what we try, the server does not even try to boot.

We have tried:
-Known good RAM
-Known good PSU
-Known good CPU
-Known good control panel
-New CMOS battery

What you are planning to carry out is called Disk Roaming. Disk Roaming is a feature that is supported on the H710P controller. When you move hard disks from one slot of the backplane to another or from one cable connection to another, the controller will automatically recognize the relocated disks and associate them with their respective Virtual Disks (VD). Note that Disk Roaming can only be performed when the server is powered down. Therefore, no need for you to re-create the VDs at the end of roaming. Disk Roaming should not be performed when you have RAID level migration and/or Online Capacity Expansion in progress as it will crush your VDs. It is advisable to backup your data before doing any maintenance.

"Hi.
I was tasked to purchase a new server for the new Oracle ERP (customized, not from Oracle itself) for a company. ERP users will be less than 50 users.
I am currently looking at R730 with the following configurations in mind.
1x Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4
8x 16GB 2400MT/s RDIMM
8x 300GB 15K 12GB/s SAS Drives

This would be my first implementation of a server so I honestly don't know it this config is enough for an Oracle database with less than 50 concurrent users. Or maybe it is even an overkill.
Also, I don't know what to do with the drives, should I get 8x300GB and run in RAID 10? What RAID and size is applicable for an ERP system(Oracle database)?
This are the client's requirements.
1. Hyper-V
2. 2 VM - 1 ERP, 1 Domain Controller
That's it. That's the info they gave me.

So my questions again are.
1. Does my initial config OK for an ERP system?
2. What RAID configuration and size of disk should I get? Client said that from their current system data size is 2-3GB/year.

Hyper-V will be installed on the RAID 1. Hyper-V will manage all your VM's. The VHD (Virtual Hard Disk) for you VM's can be stored anywhere. IF you create a domain controller as a VM, you would put the VHD for that VM on the RAID 1, OR you could simply set up the host as a VM ... I don't see any reason to make it a VM. The VHD for your DB would be on the RAID 10.
1. Yes, although if you were considering 4xSAS RAID 10, you would probably be fine with 2xSSD.
2. Yes.

"Hi There,
I have been experiencing problems with my PowerEdge T320 IDRAC Controller.  It appears to be a known issue introduced with Firmware version 1.50.50, which is the one shipped with my machine.
Basically the device reports that all the user sessions are in use. (RAC0218).  I'm running Windows 2008 Server R2.

To solve this problem I located the update version of the IDRAC firmware for my system. 1.57.57
Downloaded the windows EXE file and ran it.

The release notes say a reboot is not required.

At the end of the install I received a message in a dialog box.
"" Device iDRAC7, Application: iDRAC7 Failed to access Virtual USB Device""
Then the following message in the firmware upgrade installer informational window.

""This message can be safely ignored"" with lots of stuff about R2 IPMI drivers.

My problem is that the Dell OpenManage Server Administrator still reports the old firmware version number.

I reset the iDRAC from the C: prompt using ""racadm racreset soft"" which reported success.
This didn't make any difference.

I have cleared out my browsers cache as well.

Any ideas how I can tell if my firmware has actually been upgraded?

I downloaded and installed that but it failed with the same error about ""Failed to Access virtual USB device""
The nice Dell support guy reckoned it is due to an incompatible BIOS version.  I currently have 2.0.22 and the latest version is 2.3.3.  So I took his word for it.
I successfully installed the BIOS update which required a reboot.  I then had another go at the iDRAC firmware update to 1.66.65 and this time it worked WHOO HOO!!

The issue likely is due to a Dell OEM Identity Module, the OEM Identity Module is basically a repository file in which branding or customization attributes are centrally stored and used by BIOS, iDRAC, and other subsystems. For many solutions, the Identity will be used in place of custom BIOS, Firmware or Software. It is stored in a protected partition on the motherboard. Now we have this file here, but I think that is to de-Dell brand it, not to get it back to R630. We may have to look at another systemboard to restore.

"Hello, 
There are three Dell R520 servers need to update firmware, BIOS, iDRAC and other similar devices. All the details including service tags are in the table attached. Prior to upgrade any hardware components (f.ex. install new CPU and memory modules), all those units should be updated. And so we need a plan for this update. Asked for such a plan (for BIOS and iDRAC7 only) earlier, we have been kindly provided with one, but unfortunately didn’t fulfill it due to some reasons out of technical scope. Now the topic with that plan couldn’t be located. So would you please help us to build a proper plan for those servers update, including all the necessary subsystems? 
Thanks a lot!

"Hi, I would like to use AHCI for a specific m620 blade, however although I select ahci from bios and disable the integrated controller (h310) drives are not detected by the server.
Is there another part that would go in the raid slot to have ahci ?I could not find anything else but H310 H710 H710P so I am wondering how is SATA AHCI possible?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
You cannot switch to using the chipset SATA controller by simply enabling it. If you were previously using an H310 then the backplane is connected to the H310. The backplane needs to be connected to the SAS/SATA connector on the system board for the chipset controller to see the drives.
Also, the chipset only supports SATA. SAS drives will not work if the SAS backplane is connected to the system board. We have a SATA backplane for the configuration you are attempting. If your system was ordered with a PERC then it has the SAS backplane. SAS is backwards compatible with SATA, so I don't see a reason why the SAS backplane would not work. It would not be a supported configuration though.

"I have a PE 2950III located at a datacenter that has a peculiar problem.  Know it is running in an ""unsupported"" configuration, so all bets are off in regards to ""typical"" issues.  It is running Windows Server 2013 Datacenter with Hyper-V and a few child VMs.  The only role on the host is the Hyper-V role and the VMs are all Windows Server 2016.  There are Storage Spaces set up on the server, and all 6 disks are configured RAID 0, which should be the same as presenting all disks as individual disks.  The Storage Spaces are working correctly.  The odd thing is that the server appears to spontaneously reboot, and *only on the weekends.*  When I use the DRAC to access the server, the PERC6i is showing a virtual disk is missing.  This is not really a problem since the redundancy of the disks are taken care of by Storage Spaces.  This is a storage repository, so performance is not at the top of the list for the server.  When they server restarts, it states that PERC 6i is missing Virtual Disk 0, which is actually the OS/Boot Disk so the server will not boot.  It does not show any Foreign Disks installed either.
After the server is power cycled, the PERC 6i says that a foreign disk has been detected, and to press ""F"" to add it to the configuration.  Ones ""F"" is pressed, it boots normally, the VMs start, and all is well.  Does anyone happen to know what could cause the server to fail only on Saturday or Sunday, when it has the least load on it.  It is hung at the PERC BIOS screen.  Until the server is power cycled, it does not show any foreign disks present.
The unsupported part - all of the disks are not Dell certified, and three of the disks are 3TB disks, which the PERC 6i reads as 2TB.  It appears to work fine in this configuration and does not complain about non-Dell disks used in the server.  I would like to know what event can occur to cause a crash and reboot the server,  The PERC driver for the 6i us reporting a predictive failure for disk 0:0:0, which I am replacing.
I now I am venturing into uncharted territory and unsupported territory.  I am only hoping this will limp along until January 1 2017 The server appears to be shutting down gracefully based from the event log, as all services are attempting to stop before the shut down occurs, however after it shuts down, the RAID Controller stops the re-startup processes not recognizing Disk 0:0:0.  The event log does not that unsupported disks are installed, but not during boot.  I know that it is pertinent that I get off of this unsupported configuration ASAP, and that could not be more understood.  This server luckily is for backups of backups and not for LOB or important servers.All firmware is up-to-date.  Would it be possible that the 3TB disks are causing an issues (thought I personally don't see how they could) or is this a disk patrolling operation that is happening over the weekend the is crashing?If anything could toss any ideas into the ring I would certainly appreciate it.  Thanks!

					Go to Solution.","Whoollybully,
I've been struggling with the same issue.
From searching older threads on this forum, i reached the conclusion that Dell no longer has a non iDRAC (express or integrated) way to run the 'lifecycle controller repair package"", i.e. there is no way to burn an ISO file/image and run something off the DVD or USB drive at startup.
The solution for me was to redo the firmware update using the Dell Repository Manager - just for the R510. During the deploy step, when creating the iso package, click the box that says (overwrite) even if firmware levels are the same. I flashed this ISO to a USB using Rufus and redid my update and requested reboot, and magically the F10 System Services option returned to the POST page and i could get to the System Services DELL GUI.
Note that the R510 package i used the first time i just downloaded from the dell site and perhaps the download manager version is different.
Next problem. I cannot start or see the Lifecycle Controller GUI, but assume it's because i still don't have and IDRAC (express or enterprise) installed yet which i ordered. Nor can i install the OS using the System Services GUI because it say it can't find the 'catalog file' . Lastly, during POST it's telling me no boot device is available despite having succeffully installed raid and pointed the boot sequence to the drive.
It never stops :>

There is no configuration changes you can make. There may be hardware changes that you can make. The M620(VRTX) and M620 use different server modules. You might be able to swap out the VRTX server module for the normal M620 server module and get it to work in an M1000e.

"Our PowerEdge r920 server was powered off unexpectedly (along with the entire rack), and since then we have not been able to power it back on. The following two errors are showing up on the LCD display:

VLT0222: The NDC NDC PG voltage is outside of range. Contact support.
VLT0204: System board fail-safe voltage is outside of range. Contact support.

So far I have done the following:

Checked and re-seated all power cables
Unplugged all the power cables, and held the power button for 30sec to drain any remaining power
Swapped PSUs 1 and 2, and swapped PSUs 3 and 4
Plugged the server into a different power source (the UPS on the rack was the cause of the power loss)


The cause of the power outage was the UPSs on the rack dropping all power output to the rack, so everything on the rack lost power. Since then we have gotten power supplied back to the rack, and everything but the r920 server came up normally. So I'm not sure if such an abrupt loss of power, or possibly a power surge could be the cause of the voltage errors, or maybe something else.
Any and all help is appreciated. Thanks.

I cut power to the rack overnight. This morning I removed all the power cables from the server and the UPSs. I swapped PSUs 3 and 4, and re-seated PSUs 1 and 2. I again drained power from the board by holding the power button down for 30 seconds. I then plugged everything back in, and checked all the cables. I restored power to the rack and powered on the server and it came on as normal.
So I guess it was nothing special, just swapping PSU positions, re-seating them, checking and re-seating cables, and draining the board. Didn't work the first few times but going through a couple times didn't hurt and everything seems to be running fine now.

"I've got a PowerEdge 1000e with a bunch of blades plugged into it and it also has *six* M6220 ethernet switches on it.
I've configured each server so that it has a distinct IP on each switch from the following subnets:
A1 - public IPs (111.222.333.*, for example)
A2 - private IP's (192.168.10.*)
B1 - private IP's (192.168.20.*)
B2 - private IP's (192.168.30.*)
C1 - private IP's (192.168.40.*)
C2 - private IP's (192.168.50.*)
Each server A can ping any other server B on any of B's six IP's (so they can all ""see"" each other on all of the switch interfaces. 
Additionally, the CMC interface has a public IP, and it's plugged into switch A1 (the public IP switch).
Now, when I want to use the iDRAC interface (to access, say, the console of one of the servers), it works *fine* (meaning that I'm able to user a browser on one of the blades to access the iDRAC console of any *other* blade) if I assign public IP's to the iDRAC interfaces. However, if I assign an address from any of the *private* subnets (because my public IP's are scarce), I'm not able to reach the iDRAC console.
Are the iDRAC interfaces only tied to A1 or something, or is there a reason why I shouldn't be able to reach them via the other switches?

I have update the BIOS to the latest firmware 2.2.25, i have also updated the LifeCycleController firmware to the latest 2.40.40.40.  
Dell technician's have been onsite twice to replace 1) the entire systemboard (mother board), and 2) one of the PCI riser cards (which had the intrusion button).

Don't get me wrong, all this is working absolutely perfect. I just don't see these as using them to their full potential. I mean, com'on, I have 4 PowerEdge servers! Freaking beasts, even if they are a little old (okay a lot old).

"Last week we had a scheduled power outage and a PowerEdge R610 Rev II BIOS 6.4.0 was shutdown from within Windows 2008 R2 cleanly.
Power was cut for electrical work and then restored about an hour later.
The server then started by itself, I've checked the relevant setting in BIOS and it is set to Last for AC power recovery.
Is this normal? The server was shut down when power was cut so my expectation would be that it would remain off until it was manually started, via DRAC or on site.
The main issue being is that the power was then cut again, this server was powered down correctly by the UPS software and then back on again when power was restored, which is good to know that worked ok. But the server should have really remained off for the night.

There's a chance it will neutralize and stop eating through before then, but I wouldn't count on it.  To mitigate, if you don't have the option to replace, spray some non-conductive contact cleaner on it and try to wipe it up with a lint-free, static-free cloth.  Q-tips/cotton swabs are usually fine for this.

All guides seem to be for Redhat and Suse. Is there a LiveCD that I can use to fix/update the firmware?
Kevin



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","The idrac and LifeCycle Controller are 2 halves of the same coin. ideally you want to update them both to the latest version on the support site. Because you are running Ubuntu, that might be a little more difficult if the Dell Update Packages (DUPs) dont run correctly under that OS. I have not tried it on that one.  there are a few ways to tackle this:
1. if you can download the idrac and LC dups and run them from within the OS, that would be easiest
2. you could try pulling power from the system for 30 seconds to reset the LC, plug power back in, then wait at least 1 minute before actually powering on the system. It is crucial that you wait so the idrac can complete its bootup while the system is off. if you have the small lcd on the front of the system, once it responds to buttons, power on the system.
3. if step 2 clears the message and you can F10 into the LC, use the Platform Update function to update the LC. 
4. its possible that you may have an old enough idrac and LC that you MUST use an OS based update package, and if that is the case, and step 1 doesnt work for you, then you will need to do one of two things. 
a. you can use the omsa live disc to boot from, then run the idrac and lc dups from a usb key.
           linux.dell.com/.../om71-firmware-live
b. install and create a repository with repository manager 1.5, then create a bootable update disc for your model system.
there is a video at this location that can show you how to create a bootable iso for your system. 
en.community.dell.com/.../1767.dell-repository-manager.aspx
there is a 3rd option called the systems build and update utility, which you can boot to, but then you will need the Dell Server Update Utility 7.1.1 or later for the update packages.  This iso is 5+GB and requires a Dual Layer disc.

"Hey all, might be a dumb question but the story behind it is that there is a SMB owner that isn't exactly in a spot to drop the $$ for a brand new server (at least yet, I am trying to buy them time) and their T610 has been rebooting randomly and it is exacerbated by the inability to communicate with the BMC which the POST erroneously states that it cannot find the iDRAC and reboots once to search for it again before it even hits the OS so we are looking at 20-30 minutes when the server is offline whenever it decides to reboot.  Windows Updates are set to ask so that the OS doesn't reboot to apply updates and the CPU, RAM, and HDDs show no error yet half the items within OpenManage are missing and ""System Services Disabled"" at POST does not allow preboot diagnostics and the Windows based diagnostics package complains about the LCL so I cannot find out any more information.  The EV logs just show a general hardware fault which Googlefu fails to turn up anything concrete.  I am pretty sure the motherboard needs replacement but my boss really hates the idea of throwing in a used part so I am trying to gather more clues.
So my question is, if we were to install a DRAC Express module, would it stop complaining about the iDRAC (BMC) and let us use the ESM or is the DRAC dependent on the BMC?  Further, I've only been able to find a video for the DRAC in an R710 and the board naturally has a different layout and I am trying to figure out what the black rectangle does in the following picture:



This looks like the DRAC Express but does not feel removable.  Can the BMC itself be replaced?  Should I just keep pushing for a motherboard?

Is that a hardware limitation that persists today, or was that sheet a function of the type and size of DIMMs available at the time of publication?  Going to QR DIMMs means dropping RAM speed to 1066MHz, so there is a penalty to be paid for using QR DIMMs in any config.  Can anyone tell me with certainty whether this limitation still exists?

Thank you for your time!

While the R815 didn't actively support 16GB dual Rank dimms at the time of it's release, it does support them currently. It looks like support was added for the dual rank 16GB dimms around the end of 2011. 
One thing I would verify before trying to install them is that the R815 BIOS and iDrac are up to date and current.

"I'm noticing that when populating the first DIMM in each channel (i.e. 3 of the 4 memory slots per processor) with PC3L memory, it runs at 1.35V, as it should.
When I add a DIMM to the fourth slot, memory runs at 1.5V, thereby disregarding the low voltage benefit.
The T410 technical guide says ""When operating at the lower voltage, additional frequency and population restrictions can take effect.""  Is filling all memory slots considered a population restriction in this context?  
Seems like a pretty common thing to do (filling all memory slots)...

Unfortunately populating three memory modules per channel is not supported at 1.35 V. Systems with 1.35 V memory will also operate the memory modules at 1.5 V if any of the following conditions exist:

Intel Xeon 5500 series processors
two 1333 MHz DIMMs per channel
a mixture of both standard and low voltage memory modules

I press F1 and I don't see anything unusual.  So, I escape and it eventually gets back to the same place.

Just prior to this happening the server was booting fine.  One of the other server tech's in our church (we are a small organization with volunteer support) removed the SAS drives that were in Raid 1 configuration and replaced them with SATA drives and he said he reset the SAS Configuration utility so that it would be RAID 0.  I am not familiar with the SAS 5 configuration utility so I don't know how to check if he did it properly but it seems unusual that this error now shows up after he made the changes.
How can I resolve this problem?

"Good afternoon everybody.

Yesterday I pursached a second-hand Dell Poweredge 840 to run as a backup server, I am having some problems with it however that I cannot figure out.

I installed the server with Windows Server Edition 2003 x86 and downloaded the drivers from the Dell website. It works flawlessly, except for one problem:USB keyboards and mice refuse to work.
PS/2 works fine however, but any USB keyboard or mouse refuses to work.

USB Flash drives do read fine, that's the way I used to get some files on the machine before it was connected to the network, but USB keyboard and mice won't work.

They are not recognized upon boot and do not allow entering the BIOS setup, after Windows startup they are still not recognized. Windows shows the device as an unknown device.

I tried booting off a Lubuntu 14.04 live CD, in which the USB keyboard and mouse wouldn't work either. Only PS/2 wants to work.

I tried some different types of USB mice:

Microsoft mouse
Acer OEM mouse
Logitech M-U0007 laser mouse


None of these would work, although they work fine on my personal laptop, the main fileserver which is a HP model and a Dell Optiplex desktop computer.

I tried a couple different USB keyboards as well, but they refuse to work.

I ended up borrowing a pair of PS/2 keyboard and mouse to setup the server, but I would like it to work with my USB keyboard and mouse.
Just for the record: USB flash drives do work fine, it's just keyboard and mouse that won't work.

Does anybody know how I can make this happen?

Except for memory channels that are unused, all populated memory channels must have identical configurations.
In a dual-processor configuration, the memory configuration for each processor must be identical.
Memory modules of different sizes can be mixed within a memory channel (for example, 2-GB and 4-GB), but all populated channels must have identical configurations. This applies to only channel 0.

Questions:

Can I put an 8G dual ranked chip in the empty slot A4 for a net of 20gb? That would mean channel 0 = 12gb, channels 1 and 2 would be 4gb each.
Can I move a 4gb chip from A3 to A4 and put an 8GB chip in A3? Channel 0 = 8GB, Channel 1 = 4GB, Channel 3 = 8GB

Here is a simplified version of the guidelines:
All DIMMs within a branch must be identical. The branches are {1,2,3} and {4}.
The T410 supports flexible memory configurations, so there are many unsupported populations that will work. The most optimal configuration will be if all memory is identical.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","The 8GB memory you bought is a low voltage double data rate3 type dual rank error correcting dual in line memory modules with registeres (on the address lines?). They are compatible with your T610 and should  work without issue (assuming there are no previously unknown hardware faults).
Which slots you place the RDIMMs into will depend on the BIOS Memory mode settings you specify. If i understand correctly, this in turn can have impact on the memory speed obtained. 
I'd 1st set BIOS memory mode to ""Advanced ECC"" and place your RDIMS into the 4 slots closest to CPU1 leaving the furthest 2 slots empty. Then i'd run a memory benchmark to check the performance.
You could also try changing BIOS memory mode to ""Optimised"" and place the RDIMM's into the 3 white slots with the 4th in the black slot furthest from the CPU (marked A4). Then run a memory benchmark and compare with the above configuration. 
Either configuration should give you 32GB. 
You don't mention what type, size or number of DIMMs you previously had installed within your system so it's impossible to say if they can be reused or how. But since you mention you are replacing them, i guess it's not relevant anyway. However, if your old memory was UDIMM type (unbuffered = no registers on data lines), it's safe to say you can't mix UDIMM's with RDIMM's. If you old memory were RDIMM's you may be able to reuse them (but if they are not low voltage type, you will not get the low voltage benifit from your new memory as it will work at thehigher voltage and thus consume more power than would otherwise be the case).

"Hello,
I was planning to setup a renderfarm, using several desktops, when I stumbled across the C6100 XS23-TY3 poweredge.
At first glance, this solution would be much cheaper with faster rendertimes (according to cinebench scores). But I don't know if all the hassle, to make a C6100 up and running, is worth it.
So as I'm a total newbie, when it comes to cloud servers, I have several questions regarding the c6100.
1) When it comes to Windows OS, I suppose I have to use Windows 2008 R2 or 2012 ? What is the best/most reliable option  ?
2) I suppose I have to install Windows on each node ? 
3) And does windows suffice to make the C6100 up and running, or do I need other software as well ?
4) As the C6100 has a sata controller, can I use a SSD drive instead of a SAS drive ? And if so, is it also Plug'n Play like in regular desktops or is there more to it ? 
5) If I have to install software on each node, can this be done in one go, without accessing each node separately ? I'm aware that there are renderfarms, which consists of 3000 nodes or more. I can't imagine they have to remote desktop each node, in order to install a new plugin.

2. Yes, you have to install an OS on every node.
 
3. It will be functional with just the OS.
 
4. There are SAS RAID cards available that will allow it to use SAS or SSD drives. You would have to create a RAID array.
 
5. Typically a large environment like this would use Vmware and you would deploy VM images to all of the systems and could manage a single image.

"I have a Win 2008 R2 (and then upgraded to 2012 R2) DHCP server which was getting loads of BAD_ADDRESS filling up the scope in vlan1.  All other scopes for other vlans were unaffected.  Wireshark indicated a the dell mac address for the management of IOA which the switch showed on our PortChannel3 (two 10gbe fiber optic interfaces).
 
But in our IOA config we have a static IP set of 10.1.0.103/16. The DHCP server is at 10.1.1.1/16 and also offers ip's in other scopes (vlan2 10.2.1.1/16, vlan3 10.3.1.1/16, vlan4 10.4.1.1/16 and vlan5 10.5.1.1/16).
I had to put the Dell IOA mac address in the DHCP deny filter list and enable it so that it would not respond and plug up our address space full of BAD_ADDRESS.
Any idea why the IOA is doing dhcp requests even though we set it for a static IP?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Ok i think I may have found something.  On the switch config I am able to access it by ssh to the CMC and issuing a connect command to switch-1.
I see that in show run it has this entry
interface Vlan 1
 ip address dhcp
 mtu 2500
 no shutdown
So I conf t and enter 
no ip address dhcp
Now I'm running wireshark and havent seen this mac address in my filter for bootp at all yet.  They may have been the problem.  What's weird is who knows why if it was on DHCP, that our server wouldn't of just given it an IP address and be done with it.  Who knows why every minute the IOA kept DHCP and our server kept declining it then marking it a bad address.
Anyway I don't need an ip address on vlan1 on the IOA because were not having it doing any L3.  I also already have an IP address on management ethernet 0/0 but I can't manage it anyway to its direct IP unless I shutdown the Gig e port that the CMC chassis management is plugged into on our core switch.  So I manage it by ssh to the CMC and issuing a connect command.
The other IOA is on its own isolated Brocade switch with its own IP scheme and everything, which is NOT connected to our lan.  This brocade switch is simply an IP storage network for NFS to virtual machines and our backup appliance.

"Hi there,

this is a question concerned with the first steps
using iDRAC (in a special setup). I think I have to dig through
the stuff but my hope is you can give me basic info to let
me carry on a little bit more targeted….

in a remote LAN we run a poweredge 730. The IT service
configured an iDRAC with an internal IP. Parallelly we can access 
a root server within the same remote LAN. So logged into the iDRAC via ssh
and changed the password. Unfortunately we
don’t have access to their vpn. So my questions is what could
be the best solution in order to access it:

1.) let them configure an external IP  
2.) on the shell I can see that the IDRAC interface opens 4 ports:
     22/tcp   open  ssh
     80/tcp   open  http 
     443/tcp  open  https
     5900/tcp open  vnc
     Could it be a more or less good solution to make a port forwarding e.g. with iptables
     from that root server in the remote LAN in order to enable access to the iDRAC from remote ?
   
Sorry for this beginner questions. The main thing I’d like ask is how the 
client is look like, i.e. do we have a web based solution here or do I have
to download client program similar to the graphical client that let allows people 
to administer an ESXi Host.

Looking forward to you answers. Some short info , link etc. would be great.

Also note that even though the Dell T630 order page provides an option for a ""GPU enablement kit"", there is no such kit that can be ordered post sale. Calling it a ""kit"" gives a false impression that a kit actually exists, which it does not.
Either Dell should change the wording on it's order page to clarify it's not a kit as such OR get off its behind and actually design a kit that can be used to update the T630 to allow for GPU cards to be installed (if it wasn't ordered with such a capability).

"Hi Team,
i have confusion in rules of memory population in dell poweredge servers for all generation.

Please provide me rules and difference between udimm, rdimm,lrdimm.

Regards,
Dhruvik



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Ghadiyadhruvik,

The memory population rules will be specific to each server models, so you would need to be more specific on which server you need it for.
Now as far as the differences in the dimms. 
RDIMMS - RDIMMs add a register, which buffers the address and command signals.The integrated memory controller in the CPU sees the register instead of addressing the memory chips directly.
UDIMMS - The memory controller inside your CPU addresses each memory chip of your UDIMM individually and in parallel. However, each memory chip places a certain amount of capacitance on the memory channel and thus weakens the high frequency signals through that channel. As a result, the channel can only take a limited number of memory chips.
LRDIMMS - Load Reduced DIMMs replace the register with an Isolation Memory Buffer component. The iMB buffers the Command, Address, and data signals.
Let me know what model server you are working with and I can get the specific memory population rules for you. You can also find the memory population rules in the manual for that specific system.

"I'm assuming this is a supported migration path, however I'm trying to find documentation on the exact process and haven't been successful so far.  I've seen comments regarding other controllers (i.e. Perc 6i/R to a H700) stating that importing a RAID with the OS isn't supported (OS will bluescreen).

So I guess my question is, is this a supported migration path?  What are the exact steps?  I'm assuming I just pull the 6/i, put in the H700i, boot, update drivers/firmware, and done.

The R820 supports both standard and low voltage dimms. That includes the 1866MHz range as well. We offer a 32GB 1866MHz 1.5 volt dimm, part # JGGRT. As well as 16GB dimms at the 1866MHz range (part # 12C23), which appear to be standard voltage (1.5v) as well.

After experiencing this problem on another Dell system with a different Seagate update it appears to be related to systems with Exchange installed on SBS (Small Business Server) systems.
Taking your I/O comments on board I shut down all services (including Exchange and SQL) and verified from performance monitors that the disks were idle. However the update still failed (on both systems).
I then scheduled the update for a regular patch round, and applied immediately after reboot. It then worked fine on both systems.
Strange given that the I/O on startup was very high as services are starting and the Exchange store is mounting, but the update still completes OK.
Therefore to assist anyone experiencing this issue, it is definitely recommended to take the advice of applying immediately after a restart of the server (regardless of I/O).
The invalid image file error message is misleading, as it implies there is something wrong with the update itself, corruption or otherwise. There does appear to be a correlation with the length of time the server has been running and the failure of the update, regardless of I/O, which a reboot fixes.
Anyway, problem now solved! Hope this helps other people in future.

The flash.bat executable refused to downgrade the FW version :emotion-7:
However, looking at the .bat files, I could see that flash.bat called xflash.bat which called sasflash.exe which is an LSI utility to update the card firmware.
I found an old manual with the arguments that sasflash.exe take here and used the -fwdown switch to wipe the card and downgrade the firmware.
When the server booted back up the virtual drive was back. Phew!

You will just need to create another Raid 0 with the 750GB drive, as you had with the 146GB drive. Then assign it in the OS.
With the 146GB drive, when you get the new one inserted, just select Reconfigure from the drop down menu and then select the original 146GB drive. That will cause the new one to mirror to the original and then convert it to a Raid 1.

"I am upgrading a PowerEdge T310 for a customer that was originally shipped w/ a single HDD and no RAID controller (single drive is connected to mobo).
I have purchased a PERC H700 controller and the X394K cable and hooked everything up.  There does not seem to be anything to connect the drives to the power supply, except for a 12-pin connector labeld ""P3A"".  But, the server does not have a connector anywhere I can connect that to.  The only thing available is an 8-pin connector from the power supply. 
Is there an adapter cable to go from the 8-pin to the 12-pin? Or do I need something other than the X394K cable, which provides the SATA data connector and the power in a single molded unit?
Please advise.

"Hi There,
I've posted this thread earlier about a disk failure in my server. And now I'm waiting for the replacement disk by Dell. However, I haven't shutdown or restarted the server till there was a power cut yesterday. In the meantime, server never had such a noise earlier as it was running smoothly.
After the power cut yesterday, I have shutdown the server to make sure it get a proper power off, then switched on the server later when the power was up. I can make sure I didn't do any changes except for the disk failure. Once the server was boot up, it started to produce the loudest noise it could ever do. So, I have done another restart just to make sure that I don't miss anything. However, it started the same noise but it was average not the loudest as before.
So, I'm assuming this is because of the disk failure and the hardware or the RAID is trying to rebuild/find the failed disk... I'm not sure just assuming.. Any advise will be great.

The system will have varying levels of acoustic output based on utilization. If the system is at idle it will be very quiet, but if the system is being highly utilized it will put out much more heat and cause the fans to run at much higher RPM.
If this is a parity array then a rebuild will cause the controller to perform many calculations above normal operations. It will also cause all of the drives in the array to put off more heat while the controller reads from each of them.
If the fans continue at high RPM after the rebuild is complete then I would suggest reviewing the thermals throughout the system.

"Hi all,
I have a R415 with a H200 in the PCI-e slot. I need to remove this to make way for another expansion card, so need to find a solution to the hard drive connection issue this leaves.
We are using a SAN so the host Server has a simple 2 drives in RAID 1 configuration.
So far i can see that i have 2 options:
1) Connect the hard drives to the onboard SATA connectors, but this would involve replacing the Backplane and i assume therefore replacing the data and power cables.
2) Using the integrated SAS module by adding an compatible SAS 6/IR, S300 card, allowing use of the existing backplane and cabling.
Has anyone got a recommendation on either option?

"Hi,
We've received finally the T630 P.EDGE Server.
But during the ordering process, our Dell Reseller forget about the GPU installation Kit, necessary to power our 3 Titan X GPUs. (we have already 2x 1600 Watt PSU installed)
And as i know, this must be ""factory installed"".
I've contacted Dell Cares Pro service on twitter, and initially they said the only solution is to buy the spares parts of the GPU installation kit and try a ""workaround"" to solve the problem. 
I found on spicework.com an interesting thread about Dell PEdge issues, and one user had the same problem, forget the GPU kit, sent back the server, and received a new one within the GPU KIT installed.


So what we can do to solve our problem?

1: Open a ticket and hope to a positive response from Dell? (already done, we're waiting)
2: Order the spare parts and try to solve the problem on our own?

I've to admit that ""Dell Cares PRO"" at last responded very fast to our problem, but since our Business is situated in Italy, we've to work with the ""Italian DELL customer Care Service"".
The Italian Dell Reseller have no problem to re-pack the server and sent it back to Dell.
But we have tried about 10 times on Friday to contact by phone the DELL Customer Care in Milan but we had no luck.

I've already answered this question on Twitter. Asking on a different medium will not change my answer:
https://twitter.com/Matteo79056944/status/708564396172320768
I've contacted Dell Cares Pro service on twitter, and initially they said the only solution is to buy the spares parts of the GPU installation kit and try a ""workaround"" to solve the problem. 
No, that is not what I said. I said it would be best to work with the reseller to order the correct system.

The Italian Dell Reseller have no problem to re-pack the server and sent it back to Dell.
But we have tried about 10 times on Friday to contact by phone the DELL Customer Care in Milan but we had no luck.

Resellers cannot return equipment for a refund, and we do not perform any kind of return-to-depot upgrades for our servers. The system would have to be refunded and reordered to order the GPU kit.
Since you are likely to encounter issues getting a refund on a system ordered through a reseller I provided the part numbers you will need to get a GPU functioning in the system. That may be your only option.
There are many ways that resellers sell systems to customers. Our resellers purchase equipment directly from us and resell it to their clients. There are resellers that merely put together quotes and have their clients order the equipment directly. I don't consider any type of sale aside from when a reseller purchases from us and resells to be a reseller purchase. Any other form of purchase is a consultation service and not a resell.
If the reseller purchased from us and then resold to you then they will need to contact us about the return/refund. You should not be contacting customer care to get a refund in this scenario because you did not give us any money to refund. The refund is between us and the reseller, and part of the reseller contract is that they are not permitted returns/refunds. If you paid us directly for the system then you should be contacting customer care to request the return/refund.
Returning and reordering the correct system is your best option. If that option is not available then you can attempt to order the part numbers I provided and install them yourself. GPU kits are not supported as an after-point-of-sale upgrade, so there is not a kit or process to perform the upgrade. The parts I provided are based on my research of the reference material I have available. There is also no guarantee all of the parts will be available for purchase.

"We're a nonprofit with very limited budget and we have a working PowerEdge T105 server. We'd like to protect it by acquiring a full set of spare parts. I bought a motherboard (0D682C), an AMD Opteron 1352 processor, a heatsink assembly (GP172), a processor fan (WP747), a front I/O control panel (GP461) and a power supply (L305P-01 NH493). I borrowed RAM from our working server. I connected a floppy drive, a SATA hard drive, a keyboard, a mouse, and a VGA screen (all known good parts), and put it together on the bench without a case.
It turns on but won't boot up. That is, the power light turns green (but the four front panel lights in the GP461 I/O panel never turn on and off), the processor fan spins, the hard disk powers on and nothing else happens. I ordered another processor but it didn't help.
Our production server has a motherboard part number of 0P957K, which is different from the 0D682C that I purchased. Could this be the problem? (The Opteron fits correctly into the 0D682C.)
The memory is known good and I've tried another power supply to no avail. The floppy is never accessed. There is never any display on the VGA screen.
Before I purchase another motherboard, is there anything else to try? Could the PowerEdge require its case to start up correctly?
Any suggestions would be very much appreciated!

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Beekerc,
The R900 memory population rules are as follows;
All systems will include 4 Memory Risers 
Supported configuration is a minimum of one DIMM in each riser 
Memory must be populated beginning with DIMM Slot 1 
Additional memory must be added sequentially beginning with Slot 2 
DIMMs in the same number sockets in risers 1 & 2 or risers 3 & 4 must be the same 
Identically numbered FBDIMM sockets for both memory boards must be populated with FBDIMMs identical in terms of timing, technology, and size. Example: DIMM A1 and B1 must be identical. 
FBDIMMs installed in different socket positions (numbers) on a memory board can be different for dual-channel operation. Example: DIMMs A1 and B1 can be different from DIMMs A2 and B2. 
Additional memory can be added by installing identical pairs of DIMMs in the lowest numbered available slots. 
So to answer your question the pair would be riser A1 and B1, not 1 and 2 on riser A.
Let me know if this clarifies things.

So, to answer your question, both are true: 2TB is the limit if using the PERC 6 (or SAS 6 or S-series controllers), and 3TB is supported on the H-series controllers.

I wanted to see what the UPS thought its runtime would be in the event of a power failure, so I unplugged the PDU from wall power. When I plugged it back in, all the power supplies came back on, however 5 of the systems (4 x 495W, and 1 x 750W) reported fan failure on PS1 (PSU0037). I checked the systems, the fans were all running. I pulled the plug from the PSU, then pulled the unit from the server, reinserted it, and plugged it back in. This caused the error to clear. On one of them I tried just pulling the plug, but it didn't clear until I pulled the PSU itself.
Is this likely just buggy firmware, or is it indicative an actual problem? The 495W PSUs are PN 0N24MJA01 running fw version 07.25.7D, and the 750W is 05NF18A01 running 07.2B.7D. The systems that didn't have any issue are all the same PN & fw.

The chassis between the T110 and T110 II should be identical, as is the control panel with the LED's and USB's. So you should be able to use the good control panel from the T110 for use with the remainder of the T110II.

"Hello team,
We currently have 18x8 gb memory in our server.
We have decided that we will upgrade the server with more memory. We are thinking about this scenario:

leave 12 x 8gb
add 6 x 16 gb

This should give us 192 gb of memory.
Will this memory configuration work?

It will work as long as none of the dimms are quad ranked. That is due to the limitation that you can only use 2 of the 3 dimms per channel when they are quad ranked. Now in order for these to work, you will need to place the 16gb dimms in in the white tabbed slots, then the 12 8gb dimms in  the black tabbed slots. That should allow you to function.

With the hardware you listed, the T610 and Perc6/i would be able to use the remaining slots. This is because you have both the SAS0 and the SAS1 cables (5FM3N and RM255) that run to both sides of the backplane. 
On a side note, the Perc 6/i can support far more than the server can hold, as it supports up to 32 drives per Virtual Disk and up to 64 Virtual Disks per Perc 6/i.

"We've been running M620 blades with the 1Gb Pass Through modules with no issues. The M620s have the Qlogic\Broadcom 10Gb KR mezzanine cards for chassis slots A1\A2.
We have just bought some 10GbE Pass Through KR modules and swapped them out. into the same A1\A2 slots. When in the BIOS setup we get green link lights with our Cisco Nexus switch which shows a connection on the port but when ESXi6 loads there is no link (just orange light on the module). NICs in ESX are set to Auto (won't allow to force 10Gb as per VMWare).

Have tested firmware updates, driver updates, changing from the Dell Twinax cables to SFP+ and fibre but no link. If I put the 1GbE modules back in they work fine.

Strangely at one point I did get network up link in ESX running just one passthrough but have not been able to recreate it. Am I missing something as I cannot see a reason as to why they shouldn't work? This chassis we are testing on is quite old (2008) and we are using just for testing before we deploy these into our newer M1000e chassis.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","WingDog,
The issue you are running into is with memory channel matching. Although mixing SR and DR dimms is supported, you will still have to match  the dimm layout across the memory channels. As seen below, the channels cover 3 dimm groups per processor.

With you only having 4 of the DR dimms, you wouldn't be able to populate across all three channels per side. What I suggest is that you place the DR dimms in the slots you have them in, so A1, A2, B1, and B2. With the SR dimms though you need to place them in A4, A5, A7,A8, B4, B5, B7, and B8. That should allow the server to operate correctly. 
Let me know how it goes.

The RAM is 1600 MHz, dual rank.
I assume it has to be A1, A4, A2, A5 + B1, B4, B2, B5. Am I right? Should the Memory Mode stay or better Advanced ECC?

					Go to Solution.","Hello.
You are getting the complaint that  memory configuration not optimal because the memory channels are not balanced. Refer to the diagrammatic illustration below:

By balancing the channels we mean that the memory on slots A1, A4 &A7 have to match memory on slots A2 ,A5 &A8 and slots A3, A6 &A9. The same applies to slots on channels on CPU2, moreover  A1, A4 &A7 have to match B1, B4 &B7 and so forth. Therefore, you are correct to populate 8X16GB modules on Slots A1, A4, A2, A5 and B1, B4, B2 &B5 for optimal configuration with Memory Mode set to Optimal. Ensure that your BIOS is up to date

"I need to change the hw configuration of my poweredge, but I am not sure what I's to do and T's to cross.
I have a C2100 that appears to have some nonstandard hardware in it. Most notably, the controller on the backplane only allows RAID 1 or RAID 0 and only up to two arrays. I am trying to determine if switching out the card on this device for an H700 would be a possible solution to:
1 - Allow this system to work with drives larger than 2TB
2 - Allow me to configure the drives in with a RAID 1+0 or RAID 5 configuration 
3 - Allow me to address all 12 drives installed on the backplane (instead of only the 8 I am able to address in the LSI configuration utility)
I am assuming that I would just need to verify that the backplane and the motherboard are compatible with an H700, but I do not think I have even the slightest comprehension of the undertaking or trouble this upgrade might be. Is there any other information I would need to get? Will an H700 even work with a 12-slot backplane?

					Go to Solution.","So if it is a DCS, you're saying that just basic drivers and firmware downloads and updates are not provided by Dell? Or did I misunderstand. If that is the case, it would be a bit frustrating
That is exactly what I've stated multiple times. I will state it again to hopefully clear it up for you:
You do NOT have a C2100. You have a DCS C2100.
We have NOTHING available for a DCS system. When I say we have nothing available I mean we have NO drivers, firmware, BIOS, manuals, or any other form of documentation.
You will likely be able to locate drivers for your hardware from the download pages of similar systems like the C2100, but I would not perform any BIOS or firmware updates on a DCS system unless instructed to do so from the reseller.
Contact the reseller for information about your system. They are the only ones that can provide information.
we just parted with an HP system because HP did not have drivers or updates for THAT device. If the device we now have also faces the problems, that's rather unfortunate.
I don't seem to have done a good job explaining this to you. I've spent a lot of time trying to explain to you that you have not purchased a normal system. I'll state it again:
You do NOT have a C2100. You have a DCS C2100.
The DCS line of systems are custom datacenter solutions with specialty support contracts that are fulfilled by dedicated engineering teams. The company that bought this DCS system through us had a dedicated engineer they contacted for help with the system. They did not go to our public support site for downloads or documentation on their system. The warranty on DCS systems does not transfer, so you CANNOT contact that company's dedicated engineer team to request documentation, downloads, or support.
If you would have purchased a C2100 or ANY of our normal systems you could get documents and downloads from dell.com/support for those systems. If you are dissatisfied with the lack of available support then you should contact the reseller you purchased from. They should have made it clear you were buying a DCS system.

"Hello, 
We have a bunch (35 ish) R715s all configured exactly the same. Each with dual AMD Processors and from the factory had 8 x 2gb (1Rx8 PC3L-10600E-09-10-D0) Memory modules in it.
Recently I wanted to test adding extra ram. So I purchased 8 x 4gb (2Rx4 PC3-10600R-9-10-E1) ram. This is based on both Dells manuals and crucials webpage as to what this server would accept. When trying to install this ram these are scenarios and what comes up:

1) Add the 8 new modules to the empty ""Black"" slots. The machine won't boot at all just buzzes.
2) Take the 8 old modules out of the ""White"" slots and REPLACE with the 8 new modules. It boots but says ""Warning: The installed memory configuration is not optimal"".  Yet the bios reads 32gb of ram.
3) Take it down to only 4 modules (new modules). Putting them in as described in ""A1,B1,A2,B2"" slots. Same ""not optimal"" message appears and it reads 16gb of ram.

I have also ensured that i am running the latest firmware available. Can you please explain what i am doing wrong and my best option for the ram that I have?




					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Linxxs,
Sorry you're having memory issues with the server. The first issue you are seeing , which when trying to mix the dimms together, is that the new dimms you purchased are Rdimms. The original dimms you have in the server are Udimms, which Rdimms and Udimms can't be mixed in the same system. Hence the No Post you are seeing.
Now when installing just the 4GB Rdimms, the reason for the ""Non-Optimal"" error is that with the R715 with dual rank Rdimms, optimal would be 1333mhz dimms, where the 4GB rdimms you ordered are 1066mhz. Now these dimms will work in the server, but is not Optimal, hence the error.
Just a side note when considering the options, with Udimms you are limited to just 2gb dimms, so expanding to would only allow you to add more 2gb dimms. With the rdimms you can run as is, but will have the error, or you can trade them in for 1333mhz dimms.
Just some things to consider.

The BMC watchdog is only intended to be used in conjunction with OpenManage Server Administrator. It uses one of the OMSA DSM services for the heartbeat. If you have never had OMSA installed then I'm not sure how the BMC watchdog was turned on. It is possible to configure it through IPMI, so a monitoring utility or someone may have inadvertently turned it on via IPMI commands.
You can install OpenManage Server Administrator Managed Node and go to System>Properties>Auto Recovery. If you set this option to none then it should turn off the BMC watchdog. If it is already set to none then set it to any other option, apply, set it back to none, and then apply again.
If you enable the BMC watchdog then OMSA needs to be installed and running on the system. If you decide to uninstall OMSA then you need to disable the BMC watchdog first by setting it to none.

					Go to Solution.","Hello
If you move a drive to a controller that writes data to the drive differently than the controller that the data was originally written with it will corrupt the existing data.
At some point you are probably going to need to reinstall the operating system. You can use the Windows Recovery Environment to try to get the OS running again. You may be able to get enough functionality to backup some data, but it is unlikely the OS will ever be stable again. The data could also be corrupted.
The amount of corruption that occurred will depend on how much you tried to do on the other controller. When that other controller wrote data to the drive it replaced sections of data that were previously on the drive. The other controller may have initialized the entire drive or you may have missing data segments in various places throughout the drive.
If this data is critical and you don't have a backup then you should contact a data recovery company. The more you write to the drive the more you risk the data, so any attempts to recover using WinRE could make data recovery more difficult.

"I got a PERC H730 configured as a RAID 6 and a single VD was created that contains 6-2TB physical Disk, that gave us a total of 7.5 TB usable space . Now I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but windows server is only allowing me to create 2TB partitions and since we have the OS installed there and the owners want to keep the recovery partition and we have the OEM partition, that is giving me the option to create only 2 more partitions of 2 TB each, so I have about 3 TB that are Unallocated and I can't use it.
So, am I'm doing something wrong on windows? and if not is there a way to shrink the disk used on the main VD configured on the RAID so I can create a second disk and reclaim that unused space.
I made it as far as the reconfigure menu in Openmanage, but don't know if I can do it from there.
Any help will be appreciated.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","First, you cannot ""shrink"" RAID arrays on hardware RAID controllers, either to use less space or to use fewer disks.
Second:

Windows cannot use a ""disk"" larger than 2TB unless it is converted to a GPT disk.
Windows cannot boot a GPT ""disk"" unless installed on UEFI-enabled system.

If boot mode is set to BIOS, you are stuck - you will need to reinstall Windows with UEFI enabled or change the RAID configuration(s).

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
The BMC controls fan speeds. If the BMC is not initializing then they will run at 100%. You will likely experience performance issues as well because throttling of the CPU and memory will also occur if the BMC is not functioning correctly.
You can sometimes reflash the system BIOS and BMC, but the BMC has to be partially functional to be able to complete a firmware update. If the BMC is not initializing enough to be able to update firmware then you can try draining flea power from the system and completing no POST troubleshooting. Any hardware attached to the system can disrupt initialization of any other hardware, so no POST troubleshooting involves removing unnecessary hardware. If you recently made a change when this issue started then I would start with undoing that change.
If updating, draining flea power, and removing unnecessary hardware has no effect then you will likely need to replace the system board to correct the issue.

"Hello, I'm trying to upgrade the Ram in a Poweredge R710 server.

It currently has 6 x 4GB sticks (3 sticks for each CPU, located in slots A1,2,3 and B1, 2, 3.

I need to upgrade this to 32GB of RAM to match another servers configuration. My original plan was to remove the 4GB sticks in slots A1 and B1, and replace them with 8GB sticks. 

I did this, and the system boots, but it gives a message about invalid memory configuration. if I press F1, it still boots in to ESXi off the USB stick, and seems to work just fine. But I'd like to get rid of the error message on startup.

Do I have the sticks in the wrong slots for this configuration? I read and re-read the hardware manual, but im a little confused. it states:
""Memory modules of different sizes can be mixed within a memory channel (for example, 2-GB, 8-GB, and 4-GB), but all populated channels must have identical configurations""

So based on that, it seems like this should work, but i'm unsure if I'm missing something. Any suggestions? 



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello.
Refer to the diagrammatic illustration below:

The memory configuration is invalid because memory modules of different sizes are  mixed on different memory channels and not within a memory channel; hence the memory size on slots A1, A2, A3 & B1, B2, B3 have to match. In order to upgrade your memory to 32 GB and maintain the same memory mode, you will need 4x8GB memory modules. These will be installed either on slots A1, A4 & B1, B4 or A1, A2 & B1, B2.

"Hi There,
I am unable to access iDRAC when NIC teaming is configured. Is this as per design? Is there any workaround for this?

[tag:idrac7express]  [tag:NICteaming]



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello.
Yes, it is by design. The iDRAC Express does NOT allow you to use a dedicated NIC for remote access but rather use one of the LAN on Motherboard (LOM) as a shared port. Now, once you have Teaming on the LOM ports, then the iDRAC Express can no longer share any the ports with the team. The workaround is to upgrade to iDRAC Enterprise that uses a dedicated port separate from the NIC Team for management traffic.

The T320 has two tri-channel banks(1-3 and 4-6). You should not mix memory within a bank. In previous generation servers we did not allow the type of population you are planning, but 12th generation and later servers support flexible memory configurations. That means that we have very few population restrictions. You can put the memory almost anywhere you want. That does not mean that any population will work or be supported. It just means that we do not block non-optimal memory configurations as much as we did in the past. The best population for what you are planning would be:
16GB - 1,48GB - 2,3 5,6

"Hi 
I have a 2 years old T110 II server and I want to install an additional dual port GB card like Dell Broadcom 5720 for a Hyper-V installation and a Perc H310 card which can be easy found in my country.  But neither one is listed for compatibility with this server.  It is possibile to do that or not ???
Further, when I searched Dell site for H310 it listed only one integrated H310 different than one that I intend to buy  which appears like an ordinary PCI card ! Are they different models for H310 ??? 
Here Dell barebone servers are advirtised  like working with SAS drives but are sold without Perc controller... :-) 
 Any help or suggestion will be apreciated. Thanks



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Cgales,

Unfortunately the H310 will not work in the T110 II. This is due to the H310 being designed for use specifically in the newer 12th generation servers. In the T110, the supported hardware raid controller would be the H200, or the software raid solution with the S300. 
The H310 does have another model, which is designed for use in the Blade model of servers.
Let me know if this helps answer your question.

"I have a PowerEdge T410 server that I had purchased in July 2009.  I want to change the operating system from SBS 2008 to Windows Server 2012 R2.  Since the iso file for the new operating system is about 5.1 GB, I won't be able to use a DVD to install the new operating system.  I have created the iso file on a USB drive.  Will I be able to boot from and install Windows Server 2012 R2 using my flash drive?  If yes, what steps should I follow?

					Go to Solution.","Yes, you can use USB, but you can't simply copy the ISO to the flash drive. You can use a tool like rufus or the Microsoft USB tool, or you can do it from within Windows:
Mount ISO. In Windows 8+, just double-click the ISO to mount it. In Windows 7, use something like MagicISO to mount it. Assume the ISO mounts as drive E:.
From the Command Prompt:
diskpart
select disk 1cleancreate partition primaryactiveformat fs=fat32 quickassignexit
xcopy E:\*.* /s/e/f F:
exit
This assumes that your flash drive is assigned the drive letter F:. This also assumes that disk 1 is your flash drive. In diskpart, type ""list disk"" to make sure you ""select"" the right ""disk"".
The 5GB ISO is not a standard installation ISO and probably includes extras. The standard ISO will be under 4GB. Most current DVD drives will read DL DVD's ... you could also use that. OR you can install over the network.

					Go to Solution.","Why do you ""have to"" clear all of these? Some of this is completely unnecessary or is a sign of other issues.
1. This I can see - it has valid uses. Set the jumper to CLR, then boot up the system - you will see a message that the NVRAM jumper is installed. At this point, you can power off, unplug, and put the jumper back in its original location.
2. Yes, there might be very rare situations where you might need to do this, but only if the system has no OS and the cache is not cleared on subsequent reboots, and even then it is more likely because of bad RAID memory or battery than cache needing flushed. On newer controllers, you can do this from the controller BIOS.
3. This is cleared on every reboot - there is NO valid reason for data to be kept ""alive"" in the video RAM. If you are super concerned, power down, remove power,  hold power button down for 10 seconds.

The R710 will not support using the iDrac 7, as it's logic is embedded to the 12th Gen systems themselves. In order to upgrade the iDrac6 to the Enterprise level, you would need to add the Enterprise board (part number K869T or J675T) seen below.

"One of our R815 servers (fitted with quad AMD 6380 Opteron CPUs) halted and powered off during the night last week and on arrival in the server room, I noticed the LCD display had turned orange with a warning about a CPU voltage regulator being out of limits. After disconnecting the AC power cords, waiting a few seconds and reconnecting I powered the server back on again and the LCD message cleared and the server booted normally.
So I ran the UEFI hardware diagnostics and it came up with one error:

Test Results: fail

Error Code 2900:0221
Msg: IPMI - Nov 04 18:08:34 2015: processor:: Voltage sensor (1.2V VDDR)

Is this something to be worried about since the server has been running at full load on all 64 CPU cores for 5 days without any problems? Or does the error message actually refer to the IPMI/BMC processor CPU and not one of the Opteron CPUs?

The proper procedure before running any diagnostics is to clear any existing hardware logs. The Error Code 2900:0221 represents a previously registered error and diagnostic test failed because the system picked this historical error (2900:xxxx). Consider updating the BIOS and iDRAC firmware. Otherwise, all should be fine for now.

"Hi,
We have about 40x R820 and r720's in our fleet and have only recently noticed that no email alerts come when a critical alert is logged on a system e.g. memory problem or psu loss etc.
When looking under alerts we have entered the smtp recipients to be alerted and a test will send an email fine, but also notice that there is a section (Alerts and Remote System Log Configuration) where there is an email column and checkboxes that are unchecked.
So, I gather that if we want email alerts for any critical event, then the checkboxes need to be selected????
Is there a way to do that en-masse for 40+ servers for all critical alerts, or is it a matter of doing the grind on each and every box and selecting manually each email alert?

I don't think you can add a qualifier after an all. If you want to set only critical then I think you are going to have to set each category separately.

It should make it a lot easier to make all of these changes with multiple racadm commands.

Yes, your RAID and OS should be intact after the upgrade. The firmware upgrade will not take effect until after you restart the system. The system should be restarted after applying the update. It is best practice to always have a valid tested backup before performing any hardware/software changes on a production system.

I am looking for answer on ""why"" it will not work with 4 x 2GB and 2 x 4GB sticks using all 6 (six) available slots. 
I am wanting as much memory as possible and to utilize all the 6 slots.
I can purchase 6 sticks of ""registered"" memory, but if that will not working either I am hesitating the purchase.

The issue you are seeing is Udimm specific. As the T310 only supports up to four UDIMMs. As seen on page 109. If you were to go to Rdimms instead, you would then be able to use 3 dimms per channel, allowing you all 6 dimms.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Out of the group you listed, the only one that looks like it could be compatible would be the Hynix. Plus when looking at dimms for the R510, there is a shared dimm, but it is a 2GB. I don't see any other cross compatible ones listed. So it may be up to trial and error on the ones you have. 
Also you can mix memory brands, as dimm populations can be different as long as the population rules for each socket and mode are followed.

If dimms of different speeds are mixed, all channels across all CPUs operate at the slowest dimm's common frequency.
Only one type of dimm is allowed per system: UDIMM or RDIMM. They cannot be mixed.
The first dimm slot in each channel is color-coded with white ejection tabs for ease of identification.
Rank Sparing and Mirroring
Dimms must be installed in each channel starting with the Dimm farthest from the processor. Dimms should be installed with the largest rank count to the smallest. For example, if DR are mixed with SR Dimms, the DRs should be placed in the lowest Dimm slots then the SR Dimms.

Here are a couple part numbers if needed.
D65JJ - 4GB 1600MHz 2RX8
CPX35 - 8GB 1600MHz 2RX4 Low Voltage

"Today, I tried to apply 3 updates to 3 x Dell R620's as follows:

BIOS 2.4.3 to 2.5.2
Intel NIC firmware from 16.0.24 to 16.5.20
iDRAC Firmware Version to 2.10.10 (iDRAC Settings Version remains 1.65.65.04)

All 3 R620's had identical firmware to start.
I applied the updates to the 3 R620 systems at the same time through iDRAC Express Web GUI update mechanism.
On the first 2 of the systems, the updates worked fine.
On the last system, I'm in trouble.  When I came back to that system, it was ""booting"" and was saying ""Entering Lifecycle Controller ..."" but after half an hour it didn't!  I noticed that every time I would boot it, it would do the same thing .. ""Entering Lifecycle Controller""...  then when it got up to the point where Intel Boot Agent would initialize, there would be two dots, then a blank line.. then the machine would just sit there.
Through racadm, I managed to reset the lifecycle controller state, and remove the job queue hoping that I could just reflash the updates and everything would be fine.  Now, the system does exactly the same thing except that it doesn't try to enter the Lifecycle Controller anymore.  Now, when it's sitting there, it's not ""completely"" hung - that is, if I hit F2 it will say that it's entering system setup, hit F10 it will say that it's going to PXE boot..etc... in fact you can hit all the various F keys and it will say that it's going to Enter System Setup, PXE Boot, Enter BIOS Boot Menu, etc...
I'm suspicious it has to do with a botched NIC upgrade.. Here's what I see in the racadm swinventory for BIOS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------ComponentType = BIOSElementName = BIOSFQDD = BIOS.Setup.1-1InstallationDate = NARollback Version = 2.4.3-------------------------------------------------------------------ComponentType = BIOSElementName = BIOSFQDD = BIOS.Setup.1-1InstallationDate = NAAvailable Version = 2.5.2-------------------------------------------------------------------ComponentType = BIOSElementName = BIOSFQDD = BIOS.Setup.1-1InstallationDate = 2015-03-12T12:49:29ZCurrent Version = 2.4.3-------------------------------------------------------------------

So the versions got uploaded, but the current version is not the new version.
I've checked in the other systems, and it is.
Now, I've tried to go back into idrac7 web GUI, and rollback, but it says that it can't do that.At the same time, the BIOS boot screen shows the BIOS as being 2.5.2 !
I had a chat with Dell.  The conclusion was that the motherboard and possibly network daughtercard needs to be replaced... someone will come out on Friday to do that..  that being said, I'm 99% sure there's a way to fix this other than replacing the whole board.  I say 99% sure because I suspect that to solve the problem needs the system to enter the Lifecycle controller, which isn't working right now..  and any job I can queue up through the web GUI or racadm isn't going to do much if it can't access the Lifecycle controller.
I can still access the idrac via web and ssh.  I've tried to submit a job to the jobqueue to change LegacyBootProto to NONE from PXE, thinking this MIGHT get rid of the ""Intel Boot Manager"" prompt,  but when the system boots, it doesn't process it:
racadm jobqueue view-------------------------JOB QUEUE------------------------[Job ID=JID_285566585779]Job Name=Configure: NIC.Integrated.1-1-1Status=ScheduledStart Time=[Now]Expiration Time=[Not Applicable]Message=[JCP001: Task successfully scheduled.]----------------------------------------------------------
I don't even know if the problem is really the boot manager or not.
I've thought about one other possibility ... if it is the boot manager... if  I disable the daughterboard NIC through racadm, then I would immediately lose access to the idrac, and not be able to revert to the previous state, but if disabling the card would let me get further so that I could get back into the lifecycle controller, and fix things, then maybe it's worth it? Dunno.
Any thoughts?
Jason.

"Hello, I tried to find answers on the forum but nothing so far
I have this R710 at home that I use as a media server, it was running fine before a power failure the other night (no I don't have a UPS :-(
When power got back, I noticed one of the PSUs light was off, so I took it out of the unit, but still the unit won't turn on.
I still have one supposedly good PSU because the little green LED on the mobo turns on, and I can access the iDRAC, this feature I didn't know before searchin the net for answers, I'm kind of novice with servers.
When I access the iDRAC, on the power supply page, I see nothing, no power supply listed.
Is it possible that a power supply maybe ""half bad"", enough to work the standby circuits but not the mains?

Symptoms:
Unit won't turn on.
Can access Idrac functions, but does nothing if I try to turn it on via the ""quick launch tasks""
Power supplies are not visible on the Idrac pages.
Front display works.
Server was fine just before a power failure that took one of the PSUs
The remaining 870 PSU has the green light on, and the fan runs for about 2 seconds everytime I remove power from it.

Thanks for any help.



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Ok, well... no answers.
I've found a place locally that was selling a power supply so I got there with my server, I told them I would purchase the PSU only after I confirm the fault was actually the power supply.
Well, what do you know, the unit started properly with the new PSU, now in IDRAC I see both power supplies but on the faulty one it reads ""present, input lost""

So the answer is YES, a power supply may be faulty even if the green light is on.

Not from the ""BIOS"", per se ... but you can boot to an update utility to update the system firmware (including BIOS).
The 1750 does not support booting to USB. You will need to boot to CD/DVD (or PXE or floppy) for anything you intend to do.
You can use SUU (Server Update Utility):
http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=GHC9V&fileId=2731109500&os...
Which requires first booting to SMTD (Systems Management Tools and Documentation):
http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=P8V4X
Or you can use Repository Manager:

OR you can install an OS and update the system firmware from the OS.

"Hello,
I recently purchased a t110 ii with the Xeon E3-1230v2. I bought it for self learning and to use as workstation/homelab server. ( I got for a price lower than any equaluivalent workstation/desktop offerings). 
I searched on google for some answers and could only find posts dating 2012-2013. 
I was wondering if anyone has experience with compatible graphics cards that were launched this year or last year. 
I understand that the PCIe connector can only support upto 8x power 25w ( as read on other discussions). Are there any current generation graphics cards that I could use.
I'm not planning use this for gaming, the main use will be for virtualization and for using it as a work station once in a while. 
Secondly as far as the HDD/RAM and warranty policy from Dell,
I was planning using my own sata hard drive and possible upgrade ram later down the line. Will opening the chassis for upgrades or installing any third party components void the warranty of the machine even if those components were the reason of the failure. 
I would have purchased from Dell but unfortunately my student budget didnt permit me. 





					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","SR2002,
As Dell doesn't recommend 3rd party graphics cards, the T110II does support it. Since we dont recommend the use of them, we don't actively test the different manufacturers. Now I did come across an older post where they say they used a NVIDIA GeForce G210 512MB DDR2 PCI Express Video Card in the T110 II and it worked.
To answer your next question, adding and upgrading parts to the server will NOT void your warranty, but added devices that were not obtained through Dell will not be covered by the warranty.
Let me know if this helps answer your questions.

No, the SAS6iR does not support drive sizes larger than 2TB.
Hard Drive Controllers –    IMPORTANT NOTE! Only the Dell H700 and H800 currently support the 3TB drives (H200 will add support later this year) - NO earlier controllers, such as the PERC4/5/6, SAS5/6 (or ANY other Dell controller not mentioned) have this support and in some cases, even though you may be able to see the drive, this has NOT been tested or validated, so possible data loss could be experienced. ONLY use the Dell H700 and H800 with the proper firmware to ensure a tested and validated >2TB solution! For non-Dell controllers, contact the controller vendor for their support statement on >2TB drives.
Only PERC7 and later controllers support drive sizes larger than 2TB. If you run older controllers in pass-through/non-RAID/JBOD then you may see the full drive size.

On 12G or 13G system with iDRAC firmware version 2.10.10.10 or later, the CMOS battery status in OMSA may be shown as ""unknown"".
 
Why does this occur:
With IDRAC firmware 2.10.10.10 the SNMP resolution changed. So the battery status can not be resolved by OMSA 7.x correctly.

Update OMSA to version 8.1 or later.

what's the best combination to get this done?
Thanx




					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello.

You won't be able to accomplish the desired 48GB using the existing DIMMS. This is due to the restriction imposed by UDIMMs, which have a system maximum of 24GB. In order to exceed 24GB you would have to replace the UDIMMS with RDIMMs, which have a max capacity of 192GB. You could upgrade to 6X8GB RDIMMs (part #PK4TR) to achieve the 48GB .



Let me know whether this works for you.

"I've been running Windows Home Server on an old Dell Zion (yeah--pretty pokey), I see Dell has a great deal on an I3 PowerEdge T110 II. I did a lot of poking around in the online docs and manuals, but have a few unanswered questions:
 o Does the server have a built-in SATA controller? The manual shows 6 SATA connectors, but when I tried to configure the server for purchase, it was persistent about wanting me to chose a PERC controller card. If there is a motherboard controller, will it be adequate? 
 o Again, when trying to configure with UEFI boot, it indicated configuration conflicts. I'm ordering it without HDDs, but want to use an existing 4TB drive. I'll need to configure GBT and will need UEFI for that, I believe. Is this a problem?
 o Anyone aware of any issues with running Windows Home Server 2011 on this platform?
They are selling the unit as diskless/OSless as the default configuration. That's fine, but I wanted to buy a couple of enterprise HDDs to go along with it. When I tried to configure the system with HDDs, that's when all the configuration conflicts came up. I'll try to call in tomorrow, but I find the community is usually more knowledgeable than the sales folks. It looks like I'll buy the unit diskless and add my own drives. Any recommendations for HDDs that are reasonably reliable (and less expensive that Dell's)? I'd like to run RAID 1.
My ""adventure"" is about to begin. Thanks for the help!!

Yes, it does. Be sure to check the Onboard SATA option under Hard Drive Configuration. If you enable RAID, you will get the S100 controller ... leave RAID disabled and use Windows software RAID instead.
Again, when trying to configure with UEFI boot, it indicated configuration conflicts. I'm ordering it without HDDs, but want to use an existing 4TB drive. I'll need to configure GBT and will need UEFI for that, I believe. Is this a problem?
You can't order a server without a drive (see below **). If you plan to use your own, order it with the smallest/cheapest drive available, then swap it out later. You do NOT need to specify BIOS/UEFI at the time you order the server if you plan to swap the hard drive or install the OS yourself.
Anyone aware of any issues with running Windows Home Server 2011 on this platform?
I can't think of any, other than the fact that it is not officially ""supported"", so you may run into issues at some point, but I suspect there won't be any.
** You said they are selling it ""diskless"", which I have never seen. If you can, great, but if not then see my comment above. Enterprise disks are only required if using enterprise-class RAID controllers. Just don't use the S100 ... it is not (should not be considered) an ""enterprise-grade"" RAID solution.
""Real"" RAID controllers (like the PERC 6/i or H700) are not supported in the T110 II, so you wont' really need enterprise disks. Some have reported PERC 6/7 work in the T110 II, but it is unsupported, and if you choose to go that route, then make sure you have good disks designed for those controllers.

"Twice now I have had the Exchange 2010 guest on my W2K8 Standard Server with Hyper-V suddenly suffer a massive amount of latency and become practically locked up out of the blue.  After hours of troubleshooting, rebooting, and researching - as a last-ditch effort I noticed that the BIOS was out of date.  I upgrade BIOS and then everything magically works again.

"Hi, we need to upgrade memory on our R710s. Trying to find out the recommendations for the optimal  memory configuration for the 11th gen servers without dropping the memory speed. Came across  a doc dating back to 2009 telling that we can't go beyond 1 DIMM per channel for 2x RDIMMs without dropping the speed to 1066. I'm pretty sure after one of the BIOS updates the limit was changed from 1 to 2 DIMMs per channel. Can anybody confirm or share a more recent doc? Thanks in advance.




					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello.
The memory speed of each channel depends on the memory configuration. Yes, with the BIOS update as of May 15th 2009; Single Rank and Dual Rank memory modules support up to 1333 MHz of speed. See below general information.

For single- or dual-rank memory modules:

One memory module per channel supports up to 1333 MHz.
Two memory modules per channel supports up to 1066 MHz. (Per BIOS revision on May 15, 2009, support was added for two modules per channel at 1333 MHz speed.)
Three memory modules per channel are limited to 800 MHz regardless of the memory module speed.


For quad-rank memory modules:

One memory module per channel supports up to 1066 Mhz.
Two memory modules per channel are limited to 800 MHz, regardless of memory module speed.



If memory modules with different speeds are installed, they will operate at the speed of the slowest installed memory module(s).

					Go to Solution.","According to your advice, I need to purchase two physical servers; 1 for DC and other 1 for virtual host.
So, if you have a DC running as a virtual machine, and it is handing out DHCP and managing DNS, imagine that you accidentally reboot the server one day, it reboots on its own, or it experiences some type of hardware malfunction. Let's say you have 30 people working in the office, only 5 of whom need to access the services provided by the virtual machines, the others use web-based tools for their job. What happens is that instead of 5 people not able to do their jobs because the server is down, the other 25 can't do their jobs either, because they 1) lost their network address, 2) have no DNS, and 3) cannot authenticate to anything else on the network because there is no DC to authenticate to. Having a separate physical DC will allow you to maintain DHCP and DNS in the event that the virtual DC is unavailable.

Between VMware and Hyper-V which one will work much reasonable for this type of solution?
Do they run on top of OS or do they run as OS?

They ARE the OS. Choosing between them is completely dependent on choice, experience, environment, and cost. Hyper-V comes included in Windows Server. There is a free stand-alone version, but if you are familiar with Windows Servers and their management, this might make more sense. Otherwise, the downfall is the purchase of a Windows Server license. VMware is free, but Support is not. If you are not prepared to learn it first, you will want to consider purchasing a support contract.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello
CPU machine checks are errors detected by the CPU. They are generally caused by drivers. They can also be caused by memory, system board, or the CPU/memory controller.
The operating system is stating that this is a hardware issue because the processor halted the system when it encountered the non-maskable interrupt. The CPU was not able to recover from the error so it halted the system creating a blue screen. The dump files just point to the cause of the halt which is the processor.
I would suggest checking the hardware log within the BMC for any memory errors that occurred at the time of the blue screen. If the same memory is producing errors when the blue screens occur then swap the memory around to see if the errors follow the memory, stay with the slot, or stay with the CPU/memory controller. If you installed a driver for virtual or physical hardware around the time this issue started then that driver is likely the cause. I would update the driver if possible or uninstall it to see if the issue stops.

For one CPU, you will only be able to make use of six modules due to this limitation, hence:

For two CPUs:
A1A4, A2A5 & B1B4, B2B5: 2GB, gives memory capacity of 16GB. I would recommend using higher capacity memory modules like 4GB, 8GB or even 16GB as they offer more and robust memory expansion.

"Hi all,
I have a Dell R730 and i need to image the old server Windows server and restore it into the R730. So once its completed, the device manager shows a lot of drivers in question mark. 
Is there any tool that i can update the drivers ?

Many Thanks!



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Urbansaint,

The tool you are needing is called the Dell Server Update Utility (SUU), it is run from the OS and updates the entire server. You can find the download here. 
Now on a side note, we don't support or even really recommend using imaging between 2 servers. This is due to the fact that when imaging the new server the MAC addresses and System State Data from the original system will transfer over. This can cause instability on the system, which is why it isn't recommended.
Let me know how it goes.

"Hi, we have a PowerEdge R510 and would like to add more RAM. Currently, there are x3 4GB sticks in slots A1-A3. We bought x2 8GB sticks and are attempting to install them in any of the B1-B4 slots, but they aren't being recognized.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Blake.fletcher,
The slots B1-B4 are currently unusable since you don't have a second CPU installed. Generally, the R510 has quite unique memory configuration. Refer to the illustration below:

It has 2 banks consisting of slots A1, A2 & A3 and the other bank is just slot A4. Memory in each of the banks has to be the same and can't be mixed. For 2 CPUs, the memory has to match between the banks as well. However, for optimal performance; it is recommended that same size of memory be populated across the channels or banks. Based on your current configuration, you will have:
A1 & A2 - 8 GB, a total of 16 GB RAM. You might consider purchasing  2 more 8 GB DIMMs to populate in A4 & A3 slots. A similar configuration shall apply to the second CPU if installed.This offers optimal memory configuration for you.

"Hi,
I'm looking at replacing my aging modified PE2950 gen 3 with a server that is more power efficient, while still retaining 2 PCIe slots.
My use case is not particularly normal in that it is for a home setup and that the server will be baremetal install to act as my AD and TVServer for the house.  As such, I need to be able to add two DVB-S2 cards to the chassis to receive the satellite feed.
I know that with certain other manufacturers, installing unknown PCIe cards cause their fans to go nuts as they assume the cards are overheating.  How do Dell servers deal with this, in particular the R310?  The R310 appears to meet all my needs and I think would be perfect.
Also, until I removed the Perc 6/I from my R410 it was quite noisy, how does the Dell R310 fare for fan noise?  The system, along with everything else will be in a rack mount away from the living areas in the basement. I think I could cope with anything up to around 60dba but above that, it would be too noisy... I appreciate that 1u rack systems are not designed around being quiet but some genuine feedback here would be great.
Any help you can provide, or direction is appreciated.

Unknown/3rd party PCIe cards will cause 13g servers and likely all later generations to run fans at maximum RPM regardless of temperature. To my knowledge this is new with our 13g servers. I do not believe previous generations like 11g detected what exactly was populated in the PCIe slots. They changed fan thresholds based on whether or not the slots were populated not based on what was in the slot.
I can't say for sure what the decibels will be. We do not have a list of all possible configurations and the decibels. The highest listed configuration in my data sheet does not include add-on PCIe cards, but the listed dBA under stress with that population is 43. I can't guarantee that the system will operate under 60 dBA, but I suspect that it will.

You might have been able to reflash the BMC firmware (unless it is completely unresponsive or non-functional).
You could have tried to clear the system NVRAM.
As far as the drive goes. It is very important to learn the difference between CLEAR and IMPORT and when to use one or the other.

"Hi,
When performing a NIC update on an R820 (via DRAC) I noticed that the Task Time Limit is set to 1 hour and 40 mins!! This would cause major disruption if it really extended that far. (Actual only took 10 mins).
Can this Task Time Limit be reviewed to a more reasonable time before timing out and causing a restart?
Thx,
John Bradshaw




					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello John
I suspect that there is a good reason the timeout limit is set to that time. If it took 10 minutes to update one NIC then systems that are maximum populated with NICs could take quite a bit longer. If the threshold were set too low then the system could force a restart in the middle of an update and brick a NIC.
At this point I am not going to create an escalation on this. If you encounter a technical issue then I will be happy to look into it and bring it to the attention of our development teams, but I see nothing wrong with the current timeout threshold.

The error you are seeing (2900:0221) is referencing something existing in the hardware log of the iDrac. It normally is a reference to an error in the past. If you access the iDrac web interface and go to hardware logs, you can verify if this happened previously. Normally the error return for an issue that is currently happening will start with 4400:. When does it show this error occurring? Also, If you clear the hardware log 32bit diags won't report that error. 
With what you are describing it sounds like an OS issue, but I would suggest making sure that the server is up to date on BIOS, iDrac, and Raid Controller.  As those being excessively out of date can causes issues like this as well.  Would you also confirm what controller is installed, as well as where those devices versions are currently?
Also, in the OS could you go to System - Advanced Settings - Startup and Recovery and then verify that the is NOT a checkmark in the Automatically Restart box. This is to see if there is a STOP code that occurs before the shutdown

If the error persists, I would suggest removing anything in slot 3 and then power to see if it clears.  If so the card is likely the issue.

"Hello everyone,
Lately I decided to upgrade my server's memory to 28GB.
I just tried to put it in my server and it gave me a warning that the memory configuration was not supported.
I started to search on the internet how to put the memory in and I can't find the answer so I hope you guys can help me out.
The memory I have is the following:
3 x 4GB 2R ECC Registered 1066MHz
2 x 8GB 2R ECC Registered 1066MHz

In this server I have installed 2 processors (Intel Xeon E5620)
So far I've found out that the memory configuration on both processors has to be identical so I decided to try again with 2 x 4GB and 2 x 8GB and did still not succeed.
I've tried multiple configurations but can't find one which works.
Does anyone know if it is possible what I'm trying to achieve and if so how to achieve it?

Thanks in advance,
Olivier Smet

Sorry if my English is a little poor but I'm from the Netherlands and just 15 years old.




					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello Olivier
With that memory there will not be a supported configuration with dual processors. The memory needs to be installed in matched pairs at a minimum, and then the memory needs to be identical in both lanes. That means the minimum supported memory would be 4 matched DIMMs.
There is a diagnostic configuration where you install a single DIMM in each lane, but it is only intended for troubleshooting.
Thanks

"I recently purchased a PowserEdge T110 for our church.   However, I see that the power backup unit is setup on a 220v system.   How do I setup the PE T110 11 to accept 220v power?   Previous older tower units that I've worked with had a switch in the back but this one does not seem to have one.

With the T110 II the power supply is auto sensing, so it won't have a switch to change the voltage. The switch was removed due to advancements in technology and to simplify the servers and their setups.

"Hi All,
I'm sure I'm missing something but I've read the two technical documents regarding memory configuration in the Dell R710.
I've got a server that currently has 48GB in laid out as follows
A1 - 4GB
A4 - 4GB
A2 - 4GB
A5 - 4GB
A3 - 4GB
A6 - 4GB
(This is then the same on the B side)
According to the BIOS it's set to 'Optimized'
Now I have 2x16GB Sticks which I wanted to install, the only way I could get it working without the BIOS moaning was to install as follows:
A2 - 16GB
A5 - 4GB
A8 - 4GB
(Duplicated on B side)
Giving 72GB.
As I read the manual I should be able to mix memory sizes for 'optimized' as long as I go from A1 to A9 and so I have a further 6x4GB sticks left I want to install.
My logic is I can fill from A1 to A9, mixing the 16GB in, however when I try I get the error about A1/A2/A3 needing to be the same?
Am I missing something simple? I'm unable to make changes in the BIOS, the memory is all the same type (Purchased from Dell)



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Rob_991,

The issue you are running into is due to the R710 needing the 3 memory channels to match.  Each nine-socket set is organized into three channels with three memory sockets per channel. As shown below each processor has 3 memory channels, which when required to match, only allows a single channel to be populated.  So with only having a couple of 16GB dimms, you are only able to populate a channel on each side. What I would suggest is adding a couple more 16GB dimms and populate A1, A2, B1, B2 with them, and then place 4GB in A4,A5,A7, and A8, as well as B4, B5, B7, and finally B8. That gives you two channels on each side, as well as 96GB of memory. 




Let me know if this helps answer your question.

"Hi all
Can anyone explain why the new QLogic NIC (formerly Broadcom) firmware and driver aren't listed on the download pages for 11G-servers?
We have a bunch of R710 servers (Windows Server 2012 R2) with BCM5709C NetXtreme II NIC's which according to the release notes are compatible with these new updates.
If you go to the download page for R710 these files don't show up, (only the older Broadcom files).
If I instead run the latest SUU (15.04.200.109) on a R710, the new QLogic fw and driver are listed as upgradable.
One strange thing here is that the fw-package version in the SUU is 7.12.15.(I can't remember seeing that version on the Driver and download pages).
The version of ""QLogic BCM57xx and BCM57xxx Network Device Firmware 7.12"" that is downloadable for e.g. R720 is 7.12.17.
When checking compliance on R710 in OME with the latest catalog version, none of the new QLogic driver or firmware shows up.
I have applied these new QLogic updates on a R710 in our lab and both installed without problems and seem to work well.
I'm kind of confused now and would like to know if Dell supports the QLogic fw and driver on R710 with BCM5709C NetXtreme II NIC's.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I believe the issue was simply an oversight due to the name change, as a result of the acquisition of Broadcom by Qlogic. We will look into getting the page corrected to reflect the most current update.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Ruifaria,
Refer to the illustration below:


There are guild lines to follow when populating memory on channels. The reason your server doesn’t boot when you put MEM DIMMs on A7, A8, A9 & B7, B8, B9 is due to the limitation imposed by Quad-Rank DIMM. Once the first slot in a channel, A1 or B1 is populated by Quad-Rank DIMM, then the second slot A4 or B4 should also be a Quad-Rank DIMM or other and the last slot A7 or B7 should be left vacant.
As SysAdminTX said, “all memory channels (3 per processor with 3 dimm slots per channel on an R710) need to have the exact same memory dimm layout, unless the memory channel is left unpopulated (there do seems to be some exceptions to this though)”
This means that the MEM DIMMs on slots A1, A4 & A7 have to be the same as DIMMs on A2, A5, A8 and A3, A6, A9. Similarly, DIMMS on B1, B4 & B7 have to be same as B2, B5, B8 and B3, B6, B9. Moreover, DIMMs A1, A4 & A7 = B1, B4 & B7 and so forth.
You cannot get past 52 GB of memory because your memory channels are not balanced. The server will boot with massage,” memory configuration not optimal” You will need 4 additional Quad-Rank DIMMs for you to get optimal memory with the following matrix:
A1, A2 & A3 and B1, B2 &B3 –16GB
A4, A5 & A6 and B4, B5 &B6 – 2GB

					Go to Solution.","Blueboy84,
Yes, you can use 2 X 16GB Memory under the optimizer mode.  By populating memory banks A1 & A2 (recommended) on separate channels you achieve supported speed of up to 1333 MHz as opposed to speed of 1066MHz when you use A1 &A4 banks.
For future memory expansion I recommend you use the Single Rank DIMMs or Dual RankDIMMs as opposed to Quad Rank DIMMs. Quad Rank DIMMS use only two of the available banks in the channel.

To start, the fields on the right side of your screenshot will NOT be accessible until after Leader is selected and the Group Name entered, then select apply. If it isn't allowing that then based on the screenshot, you haven't completely disbanded the previous Chassis Group. I can determine this by the fact the Username and password are populated, which would only occur from a previous membership. When there isn't a configuration present, it will be blank and grayed out. Once Leader is selected and the Group Name entered, you would select Apply and then those fields are accessible. Now to disband a chassis group from the lead chassis you do the following:


Login with administrator privileges to the leader chassis.
Select the Lead chassis in the tree.
Click Setup > Group Administration .
In the Chassis Group page, under Role, select None, and then click Apply.
The lead chassis then communicates to all the members that they have been removed from the group. Finally the lead chassis discontinues its role. It can now be assigned as a member or a leader of another group. Now if this member chassis didn't receive the message, due to a network issue or being removed. Then you will need to disable the member from the member chassis to complete the removal. After that then you should be able to proceed..


Let me know if this helps resolve the issue.

The machine is currently configured with 8GB DIMMs in A1 and B1 (w/ two CPUs) and if I understand the guides correctly, I should be able to add the two new 8GB sticks in A2/B2.
If I try that configuration, I get a MEMBIST error that indicates A2/B2 have been disabled. I have also tried putting both of the old modules in A1 and A2 with the new modules in B1 and B2, in this case the server will not POST. I have also tried removing the old modules completely and putting the new modules in A1/B1 - this also results in no POST. I have tried other configurations as well, such as moving the new modules to A3/B3 in which case the BIOS tells me the configuration is not optimal, suggesting I move the DIMMs to A2/B2 but also gives the MEMBIST error and disables them. In any case, I do not see any MEMTEST failure messages like I've seen in some other posts on the subject.

On the English-language page description of the server says that it supports 288 gigabytes of RAM. We are still able to put only 96 gigabytes, which we absolutely do not like it. Maybe we're doing something wrong. Tell me, how much RAM you can put on that server and how to do it correctly?

					Go to Solution.","Hi there,
What you should do is actually install the memory into A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 and B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6 - you'll have 6 slots free but this should allow you to install 192GB.

"Hi all,
I'm a new-to-the-industry network technician assigned to an R620 server in a test environment. I am working on a PlanetLab project, and I'm trying to figure out how to bring this server online. I understand this sounds like a question for PL Support, but we've been stumped and at this point I'm trying to get any help or ideas I can try, in addition to working with PL Support.
As part of the installation, I have a bootable CD with a custom Linux kernel. When booted from the CD, the server should initialize network connections then contact the PL central servers and install things. However, I never manage to get past the network initialization.
The server has an Enterprise license. I assigned a public IP address to the iDRAC port, and nothing is connected to any of the ethernet port. It is on Dedicated mode. The iDRAC port is reachable remotely, and a test OS shows that I am able to make connections out from the server -- i.e none of the hardware is defective or misconfigured.
The error I got was ""Device eth0 does not exist, most likely this CD does not support your hardware.""
What I have tried so far:

Adding a tag to tell the CD to look for em1 instead of eth0. I get the same message, ""Device em1 does not exist......""
Adding a tag to tell the CD to look for the iDRAC MAC address.
Changing the mode from Dedicated to Shared and selecting LOM1 as the active interface (with a working plugged in cable).
Adding a tag to tell the CD to look for the MAC address of the LOM1 port.

The error message remains the same. As a test, I tried using the CD to boot up on a few other Dell desktop computers (I didn't note the model numbers), and this time the CD recognizes eth0 on those machines (running Windows 7 Enterprise, though it shouldn't matter since the OS was not even booted up yet). 
So there is something about the way iDRAC vs NICs work. Beyond the basic understanding of the iDRAC being a separate controller with its own network adapter, processor, etc, I am new to the DRAC technology.
Unfortunately, I cannot figure out what, and am running out of ideas. At this point, I'd appreciate greatly any ideas I can try to get the CD to recognize the DRAC network adapter. Or even one of the 4 ports. 
Thanks so much for reading.

					Go to Solution.","If I add another regular server-compatible NIC card (not an NDC), will the Lifecycle Controller be able to detect the new card?
I don't understand why you are concerned with the iDRAC and LCC with your custom OS install. You can use the iDRAC to mount your OS image, but everything past that point should have nothing to do with the iDRAC or LCC.
Mount your ISO using the iDRAC and boot from it. Once it is booted from your ISO it is no different than booting from a DVD/CD. If it is not detecting the network adapter then the issue is likely a driver problem with your OS media.
I don't think this issue has anything to do with the hardware. This is likely either an issue with the driver on your OS media or the installation script. I would suggest booting to your install media to see if it is detecting the network adapter properly. That should be a good starting point to determine whether you need to add additional drivers to the media or make changes to your script for the install to work.

It will be based on whether the existing 4GB dimms are Udimms or Rdimms. If the 4GB dimms are UDimms then the only option you would have would be adding more of the 4GB dimms to reach 48GB. Now if they are Rdimms you more options. With Rdimms you can go to 96GB with 12 8GB dimms, or even 192GB, if you were to chose 12 16GB dimms. With mixing them I would suggest adding 4 8GB dimms and placing them in A1, A2, B1, and B2. Then place the 4 4GB dimms in slots A4, A5, B4, and B5. That would leave you with a total of 48GB total. Now you can add and remove some of the dimms for different configurations, this is just a suggestion. 
Let me know if this helps answer your questions.

Does the same controller work in the Dell 2950 as R710?  How are the cables different?  Are batteries and cache different?
In general, parts are designed to compliment tech in the server, not provide backward compatibility for older, less advanced hardware. The 2950 takes the PERC 5/i, PERC 6/i, SAS 5/iR, and SAS 6/iR. The R710 can take a PERC 6/i and SAS 6/iR, but also uses the S300, H200, and H700 controllers.
PERC 5 and PERC 6 use an SFF-8484 connector; the PERC H200 and H700 use an SFF-8087 connector.
Batteries should be the same, but cache size and type are different (PERC 5/6 have 256MB; H700 has 512MB and 1024MB).

"So, I cant figure out what gen is this, what source of info should I trust?
The chassis does not have any markings like II or III, which would mean Gen1. But then, both DRAC and OpenManage say that the system revision is II, meaning Gen2. Also the list of parts in the machine in OpenManage shows the board number and google shows its Gen2. maybe the motherboard is swapped in it?
Should I trust to DRAC and OpenManage that it is Gen2 so its able to upgrade to 5300 series Xeons, even when chassis has no markings.

i've gone into bios and used the scroll lock,num lock,cap lock, and ALT keys combos  that are suppose to reset the nvram and restore factory defaults, 

but what about resetting the LC and iDrac to factory defaults, which will delete all iDRAC user credentials and IP address configuration settings also it would delete all the lifecycle logs that contain the history of all the change events, firmware upgrades, and user comments.

You can order and use 16GB dimms in the R510. You can see the population guidelines per proc on page 117 of the guide, located here. Before upgrading the memory though, you need to be  certain that you have the server up to date on BIOS, Drac, Lifecycle Controller,  and the Raid Controller.

The process outlined in the post you mentioned was to identify the Dimm with the issue, since you know the issue involves Dimm B1, the process won't be nessacary. What I would recommend is to schedule a maintenance time to down the server, then swap the dimm in B1 with another MATCHING dimm, from within the server. Then when you power up you can see if the error remains at B1, identifying an issue with the slot, or if the error follows the dimm, which identifies the dimm as the issue. That should let us know where the issue is. If the error clears completely, it may have just been that the dimm needed to be reseated.
Let me know what the results are from swapping the dimms location.

"Hi,
I inherited through my business of a T310  that has no IDRAC6 Express or Enterprise card. 
The LCD panel remains blank/dark at all times (tried with a spare one, same result), and upon boot, it reports an IDRAC6 communication failure, which is normal since there is no card, then it reboots one more time before getting into Windows just fine. It never offers me to get into a BMC configuration utility. I tried to reset the BIOS settings to default to no avail. OMSA reports no issues. Also updated BIOS to latest version 1.8.2 with no changes. Fan is super noisy and I understand that by updating the BMC firmware I have a chance to fix that, but I just can't get into any BMC configuration.
I believe there was an IDRAC6 card before, but it's not in anymore, so not sure how to clear that error. I have read that an IDRAC6 express card is OPTIONAL, so it shouldn't bother me about that.
==> I want to clear these errors from POST, be able to upgrade BMC (or iDRAC) firmware so that I can get the fan to run at acceptable noise levels.
1) How do I get the server to understand that there is NO IDRAC whatsoever, and to give me access to BMC configuration utility during POST ?
2) Is it normal that the LCD panel remains blank at all times? Power button works fine, just none of the buttons works, never get any color/light. Is it possible that it is controlled by the IDRAC/BMC, which in its current mess, can't drive it ? I understand that the LCD panel comes with the hot-plug option (not sure why btw), so in my opinion, it should work independently of the IDRAC being there or not.
I am ready to purchase an IDRAC6 Express card if there is a good chance that it will address this issue by eliminating the communication error and maybe give me access to the IDRAC config.But I would really like to understand what's happening before spending any more money on this.
Thanks!

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hi Max,
The issue could actually be caused by a motherboard problem, a functional PowerEdge server without IDRAC should not show the error message, plus if the Ctrl + E option is not showing up at all during POST, it indicates an abnormal BMC startup. 
What OS are you running on the system? I'm not sure if you are aware but the BMC update can be applied at the OS level, which are available here :

If the system is still under warranty, I would strongly recommend you to call technical support for assistance, in case if a motherboard replacement is required.

"Took T610 out of service for a planned hardware upgrade.  Been managing it via iDRAC flawlessly for 3 years. Once on the bench there was no on-board video signal. I tried 2 different working monitors. At boot time the monitor registers a signal at first, but at the time it should post the memory test the monitor goes into power save mode. So I accessed it via RAC and configured the BIOS for an external video card, a 1xPCIe, with no problems. Booted to a Win7 on an SSD and installed 5 or 6 different firmware upgrades via Dell Command 2.0. Since I need a working RAC I switched the BIOS video settings back to internal.  
Well -, now I don’t have internal video nor does the RAC ping any more. I figured that the firmware reset the iDRAC’s  fixed IP to its default, so I also tried default 192.168.0.120. I also removed reset the BIOS via the on board jumper. The front panel reports the RAC IP as how I configured it before the firmware upgrades. I re-seated the iDRAC6 Enterprise adapter and the single CPU and all DIMMS.
I have a second CPU and DIMMS and additional drives that I have not installed yet. And I just checked that the 3 year warranty ended December 2014.

					Go to Solution.","Hello Volker
The iDRAC may have switched to shared mode. Connect network cables to the integrated NIC to see if you can connect to it from there.
If that does not allow a connection then I would put the external video back in and boot to the OS. Use RACADM commands or OpenManage Server Administrator to find out what the current iDRAC settings are, and to find out if it is coming online. If the iDRAC is not coming online then you should receive an initialization failure during boot.
It sounds like the integrated video controller has failed. The iDRAC console will not work without the integrated video. The iDRAC connection issues are likely just a setting/configuration issue that occurred while troubleshooting the video issue.

Controller event log: Unexpected sense: Encl PD 20 Path 5842b0b045d63200, CDB: 12 00 00 00 04 00, Sense: 5/24/00: Controller 0 (PERC 6/i Integrated)
Is this error something to be concerned about? Just want to make sure the server isn't dying or something.
Thanks!

I'd also suggest double checking OpenManage to make sure you aren't reading any issues on the drives and to double check the status of your battery.

"I need to rebuild a PE 2850 with Windows Server STD 2003, and I can't get the server to read a USB flash drive as a floppy.

Can someone advise me on what I need to buy and which configuration I should be looking at?

With upgrading to 192GB from 144gb you would need to swap the 8GB dimms in the memory slots with the WHITE tabs (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3) with the 16gb dimms.That will ensure that the 3 channels per CPU are populated the same. It is a valid configuration.

"Hi,
I bought a PowerEdge T110 II a few years ago with an Xeon 1240 CPU and 32 wonderful Gigs of RAM. Now, this machine got spare. So I decided to use it as a coding and gaming machine.
My first tests were great. Even my old GTX285 performed very well with the server. Now, I decided to upgrade the GPU seriously and stuffed the server with a GTX760.
Now, as the server starts, the fans speed up but nothing appears on the screen (besides a non-blinking cursor which disappears as the monitor goes into power-save mode). The LEDs no (1) and (2) show up - telling me that ""Possible system resource configuration error"" had occurred.
Unfortunately I see no way to investigate further. I'd be very happy to get some tips out of the community.

So I ordered a R9 280X (Sapphire Radeon R9 280X DUAL-X OC). I plugged it in and ... nothing. again.
Then I realized that even if I'd manage to get a video card to work, I'll never be able to upgrade the GPU the next years. And that's why I finally built a complete new system and skipped the thought to boost the server.

"Hi and greets from Finland!

I'm suppose to accuire new hardware, and I'm not sure what's the most efficient way to go.

I have two options at hand: the R900 or R710/R910 Poweredge.

I'm just wondering, how much does RAM speed (not the amount but speed) affect a server that should host a website? The website/s is/are quite heavy and does at least put a toll on the viewers side of performance, but since the R900 supports only 667Mhz RAM, is it really worth to at least double the budget and go for R710/910 that supports 1333Mhz RAM?
Does the RAM speed affect a server that much?

Overall the R900 would have a total of four 2,94Ghz quad-cores and around 100 gigs of RAM, 15k HDD's
The R710/R910 would have about a third less CPU performance and around 50 gigs of RAM, thou it would be 1333Mhz.


What do you folks think?



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","This is a question involving too many variable. In the past I have seen servers with slower speed ram easily out perform servers with much faster ram, generally it is the reverse.
""The R710/R910 would have about a third less CPU performance and around 50 gigs of RAM, thou it would be 1333Mhz.""
CPU speed trumps ram speed generally, especially 33% difference, even considering web servers are primarily read intensive.
Not sure of how much disk space you need, but if it is a reasonable amount I would look into SSD drives for extreme disk speed. If not SSDs, and if you have the resources, raid 10 is pretty fast.

Try this one http://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER01263699M/9/SAS_RAID_H710PM_21.2.0-0007_A04_ZPE.exe
As to answer your questions about 64 bit, here is some additional information:
WOW64 is Microsoft's implementation of 32 bit emulation, so that you can run 32 bit applications in a 64 bit environment. It is seamless, you don't have to do anything to run an application in WOW64. It has been used for any applications that have been installed that are not native 64 bit applications since 2003 x64.
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384249(v=vs.85).aspx
Some hardware firmware updates do have 64 bit versions, but for the most part separating the updates in 32 bit and 64 bit versions provides no benefit as it is updating the firmware and not a normal running application and the benefits that 64 bit applications provide are not needed for an updater, as it won't need more than 4GB of memory, or the better memory addressing that 64 bit applications provide. In production applications 64 bit is a big advantage but for an update that runs a single time and is not needed after that it is not improving the experience.

						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Hello Tommy
Anything is possible, but going from cabled to backplane on the T320 would not be supported or simple.
Would I just install a backplane? What parts would I need?
You would need more than a backplane. You would also need different cables, and you would need some parts we do not sell. Depending on which controller you currently have you may also need a different controller if you wanted to use more than 4 of the slots on the backplane since the chipset controller only supports a maximum of 4 HDDs.
The cabled and backplane configurations use different chassis. We do not sell the chassis. You would have to modify your current chassis to create drive bays for the HDDs. The enclosure that the cabled drives use could not be used for hot plug drives.

Based on what you are saying, it sounds like the issue you are running into is due to the dimms you are populating the server with, which sound like they are UDimms. With Udimms, as well as Quad Ranked Dimms,  you are limited to 2 Dimms per channel. On the bottom of page 129 of this manual you can see this limitation. 
Let me know if this answers your question on the memory issue, or if you have Rdimms and are seeing this.

A couple things I see that would need to be clarified. In regards to processors, how many do you have installed? If you do indeed have 4 processors installed, then the minimum # of dimms that you can use is 16, as it is required to have 4 dimms per processor. If you are using 2 processors (1, 2) then the population would be A1-4 and B1-4. Table 3-2 on page 94 covers this, it  shows that the minimum number of dimms for 2 processors are 8, and 16 for 4 processors. - http://ftp.dell.com/Manuals/all-products/esuprt_ser_stor_net/esuprt_poweredge/poweredge-r815_Owner%2...

Crucial sell some similar RAM (edge.crucial.com/.../mpartspecs.aspx) which seems to be identically spec'd, aside from being 1.35V - and that page states guaranteed compatible with R810. My error is: unsupported: DIMM A1 Lockstep pair DIMM A1 & A2 disabled. Please replace the DIMM or remove the lockstep pair.
So why isn't my DIMM recognised? Is it safe to boot anyway (I can't remember if it gave me the option, I reverted back to the original 4GB sticks in order to install a new OS.)
My RAM configuration with the mismatched RAM was:
A1-A2: 16GB IBM sticks (2 slots)B1-B8: 4GB 8500R sticks (8 slots fully populated)C1-C8: 4GB 8500R sticks (8 slots fully populated)D1-D2: 16GB IBM sticks (2 slots)
On boot I get the error for both A1 and for D1, so I don't believe it was a RAM seating error since it always applied to all slots with the 16GB sticks.

There is a couple things to verify. What is the processor installed, as well as the riser version in the server? With the error you are getting it is normally due to a processor incompatibility, which in the R810 the 16GB dimms are not supported in the case that a Nehalem processor is installed. Also, the Low Voltage dimms will only be supported in the R810 if the memory riser has the roman numeral II on it. 
Let me know if this is what you are seeing.

"Hi guys,
I need help in formatting our servers i think i messed up something delete or mis configuration.we have poweredge r720 server in office and we want to reformat it to become new server. heres what i did:
1. during booting we go to lifecycle and configure raid 0 (we have 3 hard disk)
2. The system boots good and the server install the OS we have. (but we cant see the 3rd drive because we think 2 disk = Raid 0, and we are trying to see the 3rd drive as a second partition but it doesnt shown so we just decided to recreate a raid 5 to see what happen.
3. we create raid 5 via lifecycle in boot menu. but we receive errors and we stock here: the error is SWC0015.
4. Please help... i tried to boot on the installed os before but we cant its already remove maybe cause i mess in lifecycle settings i think.

					Go to Solution.","No. It depends on the status of the development cycle for the next generation of servers and parts/systems stock levels. Some systems are longer-lived in the marketing phase than others. For example, when the 12G systems began sales, you could purchase an R510 or an R520 for only a few short weeks before the R510 disappeared. The R410 and R420 were sold simultaneously for quite a while before the R410 disappeared from Dell's site. Just assume that once a new generation is ANNOUNCED that the life of the model being replaced could end very soon.

"Hi there! Newbie here.
I have a Dell Poweredge SC1425 1U Rack mount server.
I use it in my home and it sits in my office on a desk - That's because I only have 1 server, so a rack would be near pointless.
It's a little loud, which I expected since its a 1U server and I can live with it, but it would be nice if it ran a little quieter. It's not like it is a whooshing of air sound, its more of a churning engine sound (which I don't think is normal).
Programs such as Speed fan and such do not work with this server, and I am sure I am using the program right since I use it on my desktop PC all the time when I feel I need a little bit more air flow.
The BIOS doesn't seem to hold any answers to fan control and an external fan controller is near impossible to keep practical with this 1U.
So I am thinking that I should lube up the fans, but I am not sure how to go about it :(
I have lubed a fan before for a friend, but I knew a lot about the fan in question (A can of WD-40 and a steady hand was all it needed to get running quiet as a mouse). I am scared I mess up this fan because I have not got much experience with server fans. I will leave a link to a pic of the fan so you can see what it is.
One method I have tried is to put socks under the corners of the server to dampen any vibrations, but that looks silly and only saved me 1 or 2 decibels (I use a decibel meter iPhone app).

If you happen to know of any programs that can help me too, fire away. It is running Windows Server 2012 64-bit.

Here is the picture:

Once you have the fan out, a vacuum cleaner reversed (outdoors, please!) to blow out the dust bunnies is in order, and a 1"" paint brush can help in corners. I usually just take the whole machine out on the porch. Return that fine goodness to the garden.
Several hits that show (even YouTubes) how to pry up the label (sometimes also a rubber button under the label) and put a drop or two (where a drop is ~1/20th ml) of 3-in-1 or SAE20 oil right on the sleeve bearing, or the ball bearing. Wipe its chin with a paper towel or napkin, paste the sticker back down, let it sit a few minutes after rotating the blades with a finger. and give it a try.
DO NOT use WD-40 as a lubricant. It is a Water-Displacer and solvent, intended for keeping stainless missile bodies from rusting in production in San Diego, NOT a lubricant. It will help move old dried grease out of some things, but will not replace it.
3-in-1 Oil, or any common SAE-20 motor oil (even lighter grades, though box fans (10"", 20"") respond well to scavenged 10-W30 to 10-W40 (I let those bottles drain through a doubled-cap adapter for a week or so, in an out-of-the-way Patience-Station in the garage, and keep my old pump-oiler full with the proceeds.) Every six months to a year, the house fans get the brush/vacuum/oil treatment. As long as you catch them before they seize up and overheat, BEFORE the thermal fuse opens next to the windings, they can go for years. Once that happens, that fan is scrap, since it's likely that the varnish on the wire has failed as well at those temperatures.
I also have a little bottle of Tri-Flow 'High-Performance Penetrating Lubricant' with micro-teflon beads, that I got for an old disk drive that developed a squeak; the center-spindle rode on a phosphor-bronze tab for grounding near the circuit board, and had dried out. I've gone around and lubed most of my muffin fans (including the little 1"" ones in quick-change disk drawers) with that.

You will not likely have issues updating in any order, but best practice when performing updates is to start the furthest away from the system BIOS and work your way back. That means you would update the driver first.
The reason behind updating that way is because if you update something like the system BIOS first and something that loads after the system BIOS is at an older incompatible revision you would have to backflash the system BIOS to be able to get into the other device/OS to be able to update it. If you update in the correct order then you should still be able to perform updates to the outdated device to bring it to a compatible revision.

I would not recommend trying to speed up the POST/boot process. The more hardware you have in the server the slower it will be.

One of the things I would start with is taking the system to the minimum memory, which would be a single dimm in slot A1. Try powering up with only the single dimm in and see if the error clears. If not then try swapping the dimm in A1 with a known good one. If a known good dimm still fails to clear the error then we are possibly looking at the problem being the slot on the motherboard.

So we made a mistake on our order from Dell for a PowerEdge T620 server.  We ordered the server as a rack mount when the customer needs a server to be in a tower configuration.  We need a kit or just simple part numbers that will allow us to put a cover on one side which would be the top once a tower and feet for the bottom on the server so it can stand off the floor a little.
We called ProSupport and Parts department for a part number for a top cover and for the feet and all we keep getting is sorry we don't offer that as a part.  Kind of frustrating when you can order a conversion kit to go from a tower to a rack mount but nothing for going from a rack mount back to a tower.  There has to be a part number so where some how.  Has anyone else experienced this if so any help would be appreciated.

Repositories are just that, they are file repositories with a catalog. They are meant to be used in conjunction with another OpenManage product like a System Build and Update Utility or a Server Update Utility. They can be used with many other OpenManage products and Lifecycle Controllers. All of the products that the repositories work in conjunction with should have the features you are inquiring about.
When you create a repository you have the option of making an SUU. This will create an ISO that can be run in Windows. It will give an interface of current and available, and it will allow you to choose what to update. There is also an option for a bootable Linux updater. That will create an ISO that you can boot to for updating BIOS and firmware.
Created the repository folder and populated with the files I need for my PE T110 II.
That type of installation is meant to simply be a repository location. When you use a utility like the SBUU or Lifecycle Controller you can direct it to that folder location if you have set it up as an FTP site. It will use the catalog and files in that location as a repository to pull updates from.

					Go to Solution.","Hi Mike, 
We recommend using switch independent. The BACS3 offers switch independent, and dependent modes. Although an advantage of LACP has better load balancing when it comes to outbound traffic, it has is more complex.  Using switch dependent modes requires more complex configuration of the switches. 
The LAG type is a switch dependent type and thus is not recommended. Any type of LACP is switch dependent, meaning the switch ports will also need to be configured to match. 
If you are using Server 2012, we also recommended that you do not use the BASC and use the MS LBFO (Load Balance and Failover).  On older MS versions, it is just called the Smart Load Balance and Fail-over. 
Although the following link is not a MS site, it offers an easy to follow guide for some of your questions also: http://www.aidanfinn.com/?p=14004

"I have a PE 2950 that for some reason, randomly shut down during the day. Ever since that day I have been unable to start it up. Plugging in our server into multiple outlets through out the house. The server shows signs of power on the motherboard and LCD however when the power button is pressed. For a second or so, the server sounds like its turning on then immediately shuts off and the LCD displays ""E122C"".  I looked about on the forums and found nothing that helps fix this problem. We thought the NVRAM may need clearing but that didn't do us any good. Does anyone know what might be the problem and/or way to fix it?

"Dell T610 Server - SBS 2012 - Shadow Protect
Hi there
I have a Dell T610 Server which runs SBS2012.  We also have ShadowProtect to take regular backups of the server.  These backups, backup onto a RD1000 Internal Removable Disk device.
The problem, is that I can not eject the disks.  I receive the error ""The disk is currently in use""
Using Process Monitor and handle.exe, I can see that 2 Open Handles exist on the removable disk.  These open handles originate from the exe called SMSvcHost.exe.
Does anyone have any ideas why these handles are open on this disk??  How can I close these handles?? 
I assume if I can stop/clos these open handles, I will then be able to eject the disk?
Many thanks

We'll be happy to assist with your RD1000 issue. To correct this problem, you'll need download and run the following RD1000 Utilities.
You may get it directly here: downloads.dell.com/.../R312075.exe
Once installed, then you need to navigate to the following & run 2 files:
EnableBesteffort.bat
This file is located in C:\Program Files\RD1000\Service
SetupEject.exe

"I have an R610 with dual processors.  I had 16GB of RAM in the form of 8 - 2GB in a cofiguration like so:
[0] [0] [2] [2] [2] [2] PROC PROC [2] [2] [2] [2] [0] [0]
This seemed to work fine.  I just purchased 16GB more ram in the form of 2 x 8GB sticks.  I am unable to determine an optimal configuration.  What are my options to utilize more than 16GB of ram with the new 8GB sticks (that also doesn't require an F2 on reset)?
As of now I just put the two 8GB sticks in A1/B1 with all the 2GB sticks left out.  I feel like my only recourse is to buy 2 more 8GB sticks.

					Go to Solution.","Hello
There are two things to consider:
#1 Are both DIMM types the same? You cannot mix UDIMMs and RDIMMs.
#2 Memory is supposed to be installed in pairs, and in dual processor configurations both memory lanes(A, B) must have identical configurations. In a dual CPU configuration you should be installing a minimum of 4 DIMMs. Single DIMM configurations in A1/B1 are not intended for a production environment. That configuration is intended for troubleshooting.
If all of the DIMMs are the same type then your configuration should be:
1,2 - 8GB4,5 - 2GB
Alternatively you could populate:
1,2,3 - 2GB4,5 - 8GB
That will give you more memory, but may not perform as well as the first configuration. If the above configurations do not work then post more information about the specifications of the memory.
You may be able to get the memory to work in this configuration:
1,2,3 - 2GB4 - 8GB
I'm quite certain that you will receive a warning with that configuration, but I'm uncertain if the DIMM would be disabled.

"Hi, first I would like to thank everyone in advance.
I have PowerEdge T410 (11G, BMC only - no IDRAC card), and this server will be moved to some ""unfriendly"" network, with big risk of some remote access exploitation, but with absolutely no need for remote administration. Therefore I'd like to completely disable BMC management NIC functionality. So far i managed to disable IPMI in BMC setup utility (CTRL+E) and SOL (Serial-Over-Lan) with OMSA. And I'd like to know some best practises for this situation.
In the T410 HW Owner's Manual there is some mention on page 47, where system message ""MANAGEMENT SHARED NIC=<DISABLED | ENABLED>"" is mentioned. It says management shared NIC can be enabled/disabled by some ""System Management software"", so this might be some way to go, but i don't know which exactly utility to use.
So finally the question is: What utility to use for disabling management shared NIC for integrated NICs, while keeping its normal usability by OS?

It is unlikely that a driver or anything in the operating system will change the link speed. The link speed is negotiated before the operating system is loaded. This is likely just a compatibility issue with the HDD firmware and whatever device is acting as the SATA controller.
Updating firmware and BIOS on the HDDs, system board, and SATA controller may help resolve communication issues. Yes, the T605 supports speeds greater than 1.5Mb/s.

"Hi All,

Thanks!



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Jbonpland,
There are multiple ways of updating the BIOS on the R910. One of the easiest is using one of the Dell Update Packages, dependent on the OS used. There are some things to consider when updating the BIOS as well is how far behind it is, if the server is drastically out of date then it isn't recommended to go to the current version. It is best to walk the updates up. Now with updating the Raid Controller and Drac there is 2 answers. First is that with the iDrac you need to update it with the BIOS. If both are out of date then walk both up simultaneously. If you update the BIOS and leave the ESm far back then there can be a lose of communication between the two. So something to keep in mind. The second answer would be that with the Raid controller, if you are already going to bring the server down to update the other two then might take advantage of the maintenance window and update the server fully. 
Let me know what OS you are using and I can get you the information needed.

I have gone to downloads.dell.com site and downloaded previous BIOS updates ie R910010202C.exe, R910-020500C.exe and the latest R910-021000.exe, copied one of them onto a USB stick and tried to update the BIOS within LC Platform Update via USB - it reads the USB and then comes up with a Dell Non-Authorised message (which is what I was getting via the FTP update before updating iDrac & LC to a newer version).

It is likely the issue is due to the Lifecycle controller and the iDrac updating before the BIOS update, which is complicating running the update through the LC.

"I know that this topic may have been posted before but I still cannot find a clear answer as to how to reduce the fan noise of Poweredge T310 without having to make any changes to the hardware.  Is there a way of changing a setting on the BIOS?  Our unit sits next to our old Compaq server and there's a huge difference between the two in term of fan noise, when the ambience temperature is not slightly warm (ie. when the air conditioner of the room is turned off).
Any suggestion/comment will be much appreciated.

					Go to Solution.","Hi,
My name is John and work for Dell as a PowerEdge Product Manager.  Thank you for your question regarding the PowerEdge T310 fan noise.  The Dell Product Team has engaged our Design Center regarding the need to address the nosie concern raised by our customers.  Last month, (October 2010) Dell released a revised BIOS and Embedded Systems Management firmware update to improve the PowerEdge T310's acoustical and thermal performance.  
To locate the BIOS and firmware updates, you will want to go to the following link:  http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&cs=555&l=en&s=biz&SystemID=PWE_T310&...
When you go this web page you will want to check your T310 to see if you have BIOS version 1.4.1 and also the Embedded Systems Management firmware for iDRAC6, if needed, version 1.5.4.  The enhancements made to the BIOS and firmware will reduce the fan speed of the server without undesired impacts to the thermal performance of the server.  However, please note that ambient temperature of the room along with the configuration of server will be monitored by the server’s intake thermal sensors and fan speed will be managed accordingly.  For reference, Dell's thermal and acoustical testing is conducted at 23 degrees Celsius +/- 2 degrees (Approximately 73.4o F).
If there are further questions that we can help address, please let us know. Again, thank you for question and interest in our products.
Regards,
John

"Hello,
On my PowerEdge 1950, I ran into a rather interesting issue. Once I install Ubuntu, the system does not boot unless the USB which I installed the system from is connected to the server and the server is booted via the USB. This issue happens regardless of the version of Ubuntu and regardless of whether it is 86 bit or 64 bit. I am sorry if the problem sounds hard to understand but English isn't my native language so I will try to explain my problem step by step from start up:
1. I use Universal USB Installer 1.9.5.1 to allow me to install Ubuntu on the server. I tried using Ubuntu 13.10, 14.04 and 12.04 in both amd64 and i386 versions. 
2. I check whether the installation works on a desktop. Everything works fine.
3. I install the OS on the server. The installation runs successfully.
4. The server reboots and gets stuck during boot up. To be specific, these are the last two lines I see:
Press <Ctrl-E> for Remote Access Setup within 5 sec......
_ (blinking cursor)
5. The system does not respond to any input from the keyboard EXCEPT for Ctrl+Alt+Del to reboot the system.
6. I reboot the system and iirc I press F11 to go to the boot menu and select booting from USB. 
7. I see the purple Ubuntu loading screen and the system boots up.
8. I can continue using the system as long as I don't have to reboot. This includes altering files, making directories, running commands, updating, upgrading and what not. I can also unplug the USB and the system still works, meaning that I couldn't have installed the system on the USB by accident (I triple checked the settings during installation).
9. Upon reboot, I have to press F11 to boot from the USB otherwise the server hangs at the aforementioned point.
What is interesting about this issue is the fact that I cannot use the USB on the same server to reinstall Ubuntu from it, however, if I plug it into my desktop, the files were not altered, ie: the files are laid out the same way the Universal Installer set them out as.
I used this method in the past and it worked, even on the same server about 6 months ago. 
I am not sure how to solve this issue but I am pretty sure that there is no problem in the server itself as the system POSTs well without any errors, I can access all BIOS settings, etc. The only thing I am not sure of is the HDD as it seems to be the only piece of hardware which could be possibly messing up or maybe there are some options in the BIOS which are set up incorrectly, however, due to my limited knowledge, what I am saying may be very incorrect.
Thanks for any tips, 
Milan

This is a rather weird solution to a rather weird problem, however, I have tried it twice and it worked both times. I came to the solution when deciding that the hardware and the BIOS settings where correctly set up and therefore one of the only things that could cause the problem was the grub loader. I therefore searched up how to reinstall the grub loader and the problem was solved.
Problem: Ubuntu doesn't boot up without booting installation USB- System hangs on boot
Cause: Grub loader is not installed correctly.
Solution: After booting to Ubuntu via installation USB, install grub loader correctly using the following commands:
sudo grub-install /dev/sda
sudo update-grub
You can then reboot the system normally and the error should no longer come up.

Is this happening upon trying to install the OS, or just normal operations? Secondly, is there an HBA card installed in slot #5 in the server? If so try removing it and see if the error clears itself. If so then try reseating the card and see if it repeats. If it does return see if the card functions in slot #4.

"Hi Folks,

It is unlikely that this is a PSU issue since you are experiencing the same problem on two PSUs.
This could be a failed piece of hardware attached to the system board, the system board itself, or a cord or component between the PSU and the power outlet.
You should remove all unnecessary hardware(Minimum to POST), and bypass equipment like surge protectors and UPSs. If you still experience the same behavior after all of those components have been ruled out then the most likely part will be the system board.
Thanks

"This probably sounds ridiculous but I have an old rackmount PowerEdge 1950 I am trying to set up as a low-power Minecraft data backup / deduplication server, using Ubuntu, the SSH virtual file system, cp -al hard linking, and rsync --delete-before
,
I see that if I keep pulling out components the power consumption keeps on going down, yet it is still doing blazing fast doing SSH backups.
I've whittled it down to a single 1.6 ghz 4-core CPU, 2 1-gig memory modules, 1 power supply, low-power memory mode in the BIOS, and with all that, it's running at about 130 watts idle.
Next up is to see about setting it to power up on a timer before the nightly backup occurs, and then power down after the backup job completes, to save even more energy. I don't know yet, if there's a way to remotely power it up over the Internet on demand for data restores.
Also, I don't know if the hard drives must spin all the time with a PERC controller... apparently yes. I may try switching to non-PERC linux md RAID so the drives can spin down when idle. (I realize what a joke it is to do this when I have a PERC controller with battery backup, but the goal is energy savings.)
,
So anyway, I have found that if I remove the second 1.6 ghz 4-core processor it still boots fine without any POST errors. However, this leaves the CPU interface pins exposed in the socket, and I'm uncertain how to proceed as I don't want contaminants getting in the exposed CPU socket.
Should I just wipe the thermal paste off the 2nd CPU heatsink and install it over the empty CPU socket as a cover? I don't know if there's any risk of it touching the socket pins due to the spring pressure on the heatsink.
Is there an official cover that Dell makes to go over an empty 1950/2900 CPU socket?




					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Javik,

To give you an idea of how sparce you can take the server, this is the Minimum hardware required to POST.

System board
Processor (with heatsink) in socket 1
One stick of memory in slot 1
1 power supply
Control panel (to turn on system)
Sideplane
Both PCI risers in matching configuration 

Beyond that would be the raid controller and drives.
Placing the heatsink on the processor slot without the processor can cause issues if there is any contact with the contact surface of the slot, so if you attempt that you may make sure that there is no contact BEFORE powering. I am not seeing a blank/filler available for that CPU2 slot either. 
There isn't a power on timer feature for the server per se. The server does offer the ability to Wake on LAN, as well as having BIOS power settings that will allow it to power on when power is detected. So if you can find a UPS/PDU with a power on/off timer, then you could set it up that way. 
I hope this helps clarify your questions.

					Go to Solution.","Hi Preexo,
It does not have a field for DDNS in the settings, so you can’t choose a DDNS provider and give it login credentials and have to it work. You can have it register itself in DNS and pull its IP from a DHCP server and register that with the DNS server. The last link you provided is the correct answer, if it is set to DHCP it will register with DNS every time the lease expires. This is still designed around LAN access and not WAN. For external access you would still need to forward ports on the router that supports DDNS.

You will also need the DOS offline utility:

"We have a Dell C410x PCI-e expansion chassis fitted with 3 x M2090 GPU cards and 2 x K20 cards.  The host server is a C6100 fitted with two blades with iPASS connects to the C410x so that the M2090 cards connect to one blade and the K20 cards connect to the other blade. All of this is working fine with Ubuntu 14.04 installed on the host servers.
Recently we purchased three more K20 GPU cards from Dell and fiited them alongside the existing two K20 cards. Although all 5 cards are listed when running the lspci utility, the nVidia driver does not load. After some experimentation I found that the kernel cannot allocate memory for the PCI-e BAR (base address registers) if more than 2 GPUs are installed - for the nVidia K20 cards lspci -vv reports things like:
Region 0: Memory at c1000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)         Region 1: Memory at <ignored> (64-bit, prefetchable)        Region 3: Memory at <ignored> (64-bit, prefetchable)
and there are lots of errors in dmesg like:
[    0.573153] pci 0000:04:00.0: BAR 13: can't assign io (size 0xe000)[    0.573236] pci 0000:05:08.0: BAR 14: can't assign mem (size 0x200000)[    0.573320] pci 0000:05:08.0: BAR 15: can't assign mem pref (size 0x200000)
The nVidia driver reports
[   17.028050] NVRM: This PCI I/O region assigned to your NVIDIA device is invalid:[   17.028050] NVRM: BAR1 is 0M @ 0x0 (PCI:0000:14:00.0)[   17.028052] NVRM: The system BIOS may have misconfigured your GPU.[   17.028056] nvidia: probe of 0000:14:00.0 failed with error -1[   17.028241] NVRM: The NVIDIA probe routine failed for 1 device(s).[   17.028243] NVRM: None of the NVIDIA graphics adapters were initialized![   17.028244] [drm] Module unloaded[   17.028314] NVRM: NVIDIA init module failed!
The BIOS on the C6100 blade was version 1.66 and I have updated this to the latest 1.71 version but the problem remains.
There is another interesting thing: the original K20 GPU cards we bought last year have serial nos ending in 0009 and 0010 - the new ones we have just received have serial nos 0012, 0058 and 0064. Now, the card with serial # 0012 works on it's own or with either of the existing cards fitted but cards 0058 and 0064 do not work even it fitted on their own - we are seeing the same error messages reported by dmesg and lspci as we get when fitting more than 2 GPU cards. I'm guessing these are later K20 cards that are different from the earlier ones?
It seems there is a limit to the number of K20s that can be used with the C6100 and/or compatibility issues with later cards. Before I return these GPUs to Dell, does anyone know of a solution?
Thanks,
Andy

					Go to Solution.","Hello Andy
Before I return these GPUs to Dell, does anyone know of a solution?
No, I don't have a solution. I did want to make sure that you are aware that this is not a validated configuration. It is very likely that the firmware on the new K20s are not the same as the old K20s. That is likely why it is not working.
The K20s are not a validated GPGPU for the C6100. Only M series are validated for the C6100. Also, Ubuntu is not a validated OS for the C410x. I'm glad you were able to get everything working with the original setup. I just want you to be aware that this is not a validated configuration so that you understand getting these GPGPUs to function in this configuration will be trial and error.
Returning the K20s and ordering the same cards again will likely produce the same results. You may be able to flash the firmware on your new K20s to what the older K20s are running. I'm not sure if that is possible or how to do it though.

"Heres a great one for you guys..
I have TWO M520s configured identically that exhibit this problem.  Approximately every 1-2 weeks, they will slow down to about 5% of their normal speed -- as measured with some cpu benchmarking tools.
I've killed the network connection to them to limit any outside interference.. and rebooted (warm boot).  The problem still exists.  I've even tried to warm boot and boot using PXE (to eliminate the OS completely from the problem).  I run memtest86+ v5.0.1  and you can see the speed problem while doing a memory test..  horribly slow.
The only thing that will ""fix"" the issue is if I cold boot the server (power switch or via the drac works fine).  Then the servers are good to go for another 1-2 weeks before randomly slowing down again.
The hardware is a M520, single E5-2420, dimms in DIMMA_2 & 3 (16gb 1333mhz dual-rank), H710 raid, and no mezz cards.  BIOS is 2.1.4.
Things I've tried: switching from memory-mirroring to multi-bit ECC mode, upgrading RAID card (was H310) and fw,  upgrading NIC firmware, upgrading iDRAC fw (now on 1.57.57), upgrading LC fw.

That is correct. The key to the population of the dimms is that the dimm channels you described must be identically matched. So if you have 4 4gb dimms in the white tabbed slots then you can place the new 4 in black tabbed slots just adjacent to the older dimms.

"Hello, 
I have been searching for answer with mixed memory upgrading and I have found 2 answers what collide to each other. We want to upgrade our 4x r610 with 2 CPU's servers and have some load balancing. We also want to upgrade our r620. 
Configuration at this moment, (all same speeds an banks etc)
R610 # 1 12 * 16 gb 192 gbR610 # 2 12 * 16 gb 192 gbR610 # 3 12 *   8 gb   96 gbR610 # 4 12 *   8 gb   96 gb
R620 # 5   6 * 16 gb
We have bought 6x 16 gb to ad to the R620. This wont give any problem I think. 
But we want to load balance our 610 servers. Our idea was to configure them like this 6 * 16 and 6 * 8. So that the Total ram is equilized and should have same load on. As the #1 and # 2 are quite busy now. 
The configuration I wanted to use was as follows:



A1
A4
A2
A5
A3
A6
B6
B3
B5
B2
B4
B1


16
8
16
8
16
8
8
16
8
16
8
16




Now I have found 2 answers who collide to each other. 
This LINK here tells me that the only problem with mixing memory is that you will not be able to populate the third channel. It will make slots A3,A6 - B3,B6 unusable.
But this LINK tells me that is OK to mix memory and third channel can be used. Look at the last picture. They have mixed 4 and 2 gb and the texts don't mention anything about the above statement.
So the question is, is possible  to make the total ram equal each other of the R610. Or is this not smart and the configuration we have set-up now is the best option we can get, also performance wise. 
Any advise is welcome.
Thanks in advance.



					
						Solved!
					
					Go to Solution.","Gerardogd,

To clarify this for you is fairly straight forward. The problem that was being stated on the first link was that they didn't have the proper number of  dimms to fully populate all 3 memory channels, so if he didn't have enough dimms to cover all of channel 3, then those dimms that are in that channel would have to be removed. That was what was being stated.  An example of this would be like the issue you are asking. If you have 12 slots on the servers and they are split into 3 channels, you then want to upgrade with say 8 8GB and 4 4GB dimms. You could do this up to the last channel, due to there being an off number then you don't have enough of both to cover pairing against all the channels. 
That's not an issue with your case though, so not a concern. What you will need to do is place the 16gb dimms in the white tabbed slots and the 8GB dimms in the black. Then so long as you are in Optimizer mode in the BIOS for the memory mode then ýou should be golden. 
In regards to the R620, you are correct, there shouldn't be any issue.
Let me know if this helps answer your questions.
