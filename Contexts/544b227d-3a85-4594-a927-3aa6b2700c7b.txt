I would start by taking the server to a Minimum to Post configuration followed by clearing the NVRam 
To take the server to a MIn to Post you need to remove everything from the server but the following

One Power Supply
Control Panel for power button functionality
Working cable connection between control panel and system board
One Processor CPU in socket CPU minimum for troubleshooting
One Memory Module DIMM installed in socket A
System Board
Backplane for Rxd 

After taking the server to this configuration then locate the NVRamCLR on the systemboard as shown below and move the jumper over 



Once you move the jumper over then power the system to clear the Nvram Once cleared then power back down and restore the jumper 
Once the jumper is back into its original position go ahead and power the server to see if it Posts
Let me know what you see

When under the Minimum to Post configuration and the system still will not Post then it is normally one of the devices in that minimum to post list that is causing the issue If you happen to have another matching server you can move the devices listed minus the system board over to the other server to see if it is any of the removable devices causing the issue If they test and function fine then the issue is likely the system board itself
